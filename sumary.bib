  Abstract                 = {Accurate and computationally-efficient modeling of stratified mixing processes are of paramount importance in both coastal and large-scale ocean circulation. In this study, our main objective is to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of large eddy simulation (LES) as a possible tool to study small-scale oceanic processes. To this end, LES is evaluated in a 3D lock-exchange problem, which contains shear-driven mixing, internal waves, interactions with boundaries and convective motions, while having a simple domain, initial and boundary conditions, and forcing. Two general classes of LES models are tested, namely eddy viscosity (EV) models based on constant-coefficient and dynamic Smagorinsky models, and an approximate deconvolution (AD) model. By noting that the dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models have different strengths in that the former is good in providing appropriate dissipation while the latter in preserving the detail of coherent structures on coarse resolution meshes, a hybrid approach combining EV and AD models is also evaluated. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed as the benchmark solution, and all LES models are tested on three coarse meshes. The main measure of mixing is taken as the temporal evolution of background potential energy. It is found that constant-coefficient Smagorinsky models can only provide a marginal improvement over under-resolved simulations, while both dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models lead to significant improvements in mixing accuracy. The primary accomplishment of this study is that it is shown that the hybrid approach attains the best agreement with the mixing curve from DNS, while being computationally approximately a thousand times faster.},

  Abstract                 = {The respective effects of an external field and departure of suspended particles from spherical shape on the rotary motion of axisymmetric dipolar particles placed in a homogeneous shear flow are studied. The analysis shows that, owing to cumulative effects, even a weak external field or a small deviation from spherical shape can significantly modify the resulting motion relative to that found in the corresponding classical problems of torque-free particles or dipolar spheres in homogeneous shear. Thus, unlike the latter problems, there are in the present problem cases when all particles approach a single limit cycle; in other cases multiple stable equilibria simultaneously coexist and the orientation space is appropriately divided into corresponding domains of attraction; in some situations possessing appropriate symmetry properties, particles may, depending upon their respective initial orientations, either move along a family of periodic orbits or else converge to a stable equilibrium orientation.},

In the surface layer the TKE dissipation rate was systematically larger than the production of TKE predicted by wind stress and mixed-layer similarity scaling.},

  Abstract                 = {Collective decision-making in biological systems requires all individuals in the group to go through a behavioural change of state. During this transition fast and robust transfer of information is essential to prevent cohesion loss. The mechanism by which natural groups achieve such robustness, however, is not clear. Here we present an experimental study of starling flocks performing collective turns. We find that information about direction changes propagates across the flock with a linear dispersion law and negligible attenuation, hence minimizing group decoherence. These results contrast starkly with present models of collective motion, which predict diffusive transport of information. Building on spontaneous symmetry breaking and conservation-law arguments, we formulate a theory that correctly reproduces linear and undamped propagation. Essential to this framework is the inclusion of the birds/' behavioural inertia. The theory not only explains the data, but also predicts that information transfer must be faster the stronger the group/'s orientational order, a prediction accurately verified by the data. Our results suggest that swift decision-making may be the adaptive drive for the strong behavioural polarization observed in many living groups.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical Taylor--Aris dispersion theory is extended to describe the transport of suspensions of self-propelled dipolar cells in a tubular flow. General expressions for the mean drift and effective diffusivity are determined exactly in terms of axial moments and compared with an approximation Taylor. As in the Taylor--Aris case, the skewness of a finite distribution of biased swimming cells vanishes at long times. The general expressions can be applied to particular models of swimming micro-organisms, and thus be used to predict swimming drift and diffusion in tubular bioreactors, and to elucidate competing unbounded swimming drift and diffusion descriptions. Here, specific examples are presented for gyrotactic swimming algae. },

  Abstract                 = {In order to understand the daily cycle of heat storage within the surface mixed layer it is necessary to distinguish between the mixed layer, the zone of relatively homogeneous water formed by the history of mixing, and the mixing layer, the zone in which mixing is currently active. We compare surface layer definitions based on density (or temperature) with turbulence measurements to evaluate their skill in finding mixed and mixing layer depths, using definitions based on density increase from the surface, and on density gradients. Both types of definition are capable of finding the mixed layer depth, with some tuning for local conditions. Neither definition, however, gives mixing layer depths consistently matching the turbulence measurements, although density differences give more stable results. Measurements of turbulent dissipation rates or overturning length scales often yield consistent estimates of mixing layer depths, but there are cases where overturning lengths give distinctly better results. We conclude that overturning length scales give the most reliable measure of mixing layer depth, although conventional shipborne CTDs are seldom capable of sufficiently resolving the overturns.},

  Abstract                 = {The Naval Research Laboratory?s Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) is used in conjunction with satellite observations and data from the Coastal Waves 1996 experiment to investigate the dynamics of unusual wave clouds that occur upwind and offshore of orographic features along the California coast. Results indicate that supercritical flow within the marine boundary layer, interacting with blocking coastal orography, is forced to decelerate and an atmospheric bow shock forms. The location and orientation of the COAMPS forecast shock matches well with the leading edge of the wave clouds in satellite imagery, and the modeled jump in boundary layer depth across the shock is in good agreement with the aircraft observations. In the parameter space of Froude number and jump strength that develops within the flow (observed and modeled), the shock manifests itself as an undular bore. On the innermost grid (?x = ? km), long, lineal variations in the wind, temperature, and moisture fields are forecast to develop on the subcritical side of the shock front and the modeled wavelength of these perturbations is close to the observed ?4 km wavelength of the cloud lines. Their cellular structure and the quadrature between the vertical velocity and potential temperature fields strongly suggest that these are trapped internal gravity modes. Further, solutions to the Taylor?Goldstein equation for stationary waves, using a model-computed Scorer parameter profile, provide a comparable estimate of ?3 km for a trapped, resonant wavelength. The subkilometer forecasts presented are the highest-resolution real data forecasts with COAMPS to date. Time-dependent outer boundary conditions are supplied to COAMPS by the Naval Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System. The nonhydrostatic nature of the COAMPS model is essential to forecasting these nonhydrostatic, trapped waves.},

  Abstract                 = {A high-resolution numerical model is used to study the importance of spatial variability in the wind forcing to the separation of a coastal upwelling jet at a cape. An idealized topography and wind field based on observations from the Cape Blanco (Oregon) region are used. Several simulations are investigated, with both the intensity and the spatial structure of the wind forcing varied to isolate the importance of the observed intensification in the wind stress and wind stress curl magnitudes to the separation process. A simulation using a straight coast confirms that the presence of the cape is crucial for separation. Wind stress intensification by itself, with zero curl, does not aid separation. The wind stress curl intensification south of the cape, on the other hand, is important for controlling details of the process. Because the positive wind stress curl drives upwelling, isotherms in the offshore region tilt upward, creating a pressure gradient that sustains an intensification of the southward velocities via the thermal wind balance. This aids jet separation via continuity and by creating potential vorticity contours that track far offshore of the cape. The timing of the separation is dependent on the intensity of the wind stress curl (stronger curl leads to earlier separation), while how far offshore the jet is deflected depends on the offshore extent of the region of positive curl close to the coast (increasing the extent increases the deflection).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we deal with the interpretation of observed oscillations in the tropical troposphere and stratosphere within the framework of the equatorial wave theory. A difficulty with this problem arises when one compares the short vertical wavelength (or equivalent depth) predicted by the classical theory and the observed large vertical scales associated with the low Doppler-shifted frequencies of the tropospheric oscillations. In this analysis it is shown that the inclusion of simple linear damping, justified by budget studies which revealed the important role of cumulus momentum transport, has a strong influence at low frequencies on the forced equatorial waves and results in two types of dispersive relationships. The first type is characteristic of the regular internal gravity waves which have fast phase speeds and weak vertical attenuation. The second type is dominated by the viscous damping time scale and has slow phase speeds and strong vertical trapping. The theory predicts that the stratosphere oscillations may be identified with the first type and the tropospheric oscillations with the second. In the case of Kelvin waves the results can be used to explain consistently both the observed stratospheric Kelvin waves and the planetary-scale Kelvin-like oscillations in the troposphere including the 40?50 day oscillation and the monsoon and Walker circulations. Possible implications with respect to other waves in the tropics are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous case reports and regional studies on swell and wind sea events have been documented during the past century. The global picture of these common oceanic phenomena, however, is still incomplete in many aspects. This paper presents a feasibility study of using collocated wind speed and significant wave height measurements from simultaneous satellite scatterometer and altimeter sources to observe the spatial and seasonal pattern of dominant swell and wind wave zones in the world's oceans. Two energy-related normalized indices are proposed, on the basis of which global statistics of swell/wind sea probabilities and intensities are obtained. It is found that three well-defined tongue-shaped zones of swell dominance, termed ?swell pools,? are located in the eastern tropical areas of the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Indian Oceans, respectively. Regions of intensive wave growth are observed in the northwest Pacific, the northwest Atlantic, the Southern Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. Seasonality is distinct for the climate of both swell and wind sea, notably the large-scale northward bending of the swell pools in boreal summer, and the dramatic shift of wave-growing extent from a summer low to an autumn high. The results of this study may serve as a useful reference for a variety of activities, such as ocean wave modeling, satellite algorithm validation, coastal engineering, and ship routing, when information on swell and wind sea conditions is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {The oceanic surface mixed layer heat budget in the central equatorial Indian Ocean is calculated from observations at two mooring sites (0$\deg$S 79$\deg$E and 1.5$\deg$S 79$\deg$E) during three active and calm phases of Madden--Julian Oscillation (MJO) events between September 2011 and January 2012. At both mooring locations, the surface mixed layer is generally heated during MJO calm phases. During MJO active phases at both mooring locations, the surface mixed layer is always cooled by the net surface heat flux and also sometimes by the turbulent heat flux at the bottom of the surface mixed layer. The turbulent heat flux at the bottom of the surface mixed layer, however, varies greatly among different MJO active phases and between the two mooring locations. A barrier layer exerts control on the turbulent heat flux at the base of the surface mixed layer; we quantify this barrier layer strength by a {\textquotedblleft}barrier layer potential energy,{\textquotedblright} which depends on the thickness of the barrier layer, the thickness of the surface mixed layer, and the density stratification across the isothermal layer. During one observed MJO active phase, a strong turbulent heat flux into the mixed layer was diagnosed, despite the presence of a 10$-$20 m thick barrier layer. This was due to the strong shear across the barrier layer driven by the westerly winds, which provided sufficient available kinetic energy to erode the barrier layer. To better simulate and predict net surface heat fluxes and the MJO, models must estimate the oceanic barrier layer potential energy, background shear, stratification, and surface forcing accurately.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors apply a one-dimensional mixed layer model, based on second moment closure of turbulence, to study the characteristics of turbulence in the equatorial mixed layer. In particular, they focus on characteristics such as the TKE and the dissipation rate in the upper layers of the equatorial ocean, especially the phenomenon of deep episodic penetration well below the mixed layer of elevated dissipation rates commonly observed in microstructure measurements in the central tropical Pacific. Model simulations for the Tropic Heat experiments in 1984 and 1987 and Tropical Instability Wave Experiment in the central Pacific as well as the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) Intensive Operating Period (IOP) observations in the western Pacific warm pool are performed. Modeled dissipation rates are found to be in reasonable agreement with those measured by microstructure profilers during these observations. Sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the mechanisms underlying the deep penetration process. The authors find that the deep penetration of turbulence arises simply due to the instability and mixing resulting from the background vertical shear of the Equatorial Undercurrent enhanced by the easterly winds. The process is present whether or not there is nocturnal cooling. Deep penetration of turbulence is absent during westerlies, and then the behavior of the equatorial mixed layer is more like that of a high-latitude mixed layer. The modeled dissipation rates in the tropical western Pacific warm pool are in agreement with values observed during the TOGA COARE IOP. Both TKE and dissipation rates are significantly elevated in the mixed layer during westerly wind bursts. However, because of the weak background shear due to an undercurrent that is too weak and too deep in this region, turbulent mixing does not penetrate much below the mixed layer in the warm pool.},

  Abstract                 = {Nearly all operational ocean models use air-sea fluxes and the ocean shear and stratification to estimate upper ocean boundary layer mixing rates. This approach implicitly parameterizes surface wave effects in terms of these inputs. Here we test this assumption using parallel experiments in a lake with small waves and in the open ocean with much bigger waves. Under the same wind stress and adjusting for buoyancy flux, we find the mixed layer average turbulent vertical kinetic energy in the open ocean typically twice that in the lake. The increase is consistent with models of Langmuir turbulence, in which the wave Stokes drift, and not wave breaking, is the dominant mechanism by which waves energize turbulence in the mixed layer. Applying these same theories globally, we find enhanced mixing and deeper mixed layers resulting from the inclusion of Langmuir turbulence in the boundary layer parameterization, especially in the Southern Ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent efforts to empirically measure and numerically simulate biogenic ocean mixing have consistently observed low mixing efficiency. This suggests that the buoyancy flux achieved by swimming animals in the ocean may be negligible in spite of the observed large kinetic energy dissipation rates. The present letter suggests that vertical migration across isopycnals may be necessary in order to generate overturning and subsequent mixing at length scales significantly larger than the individual animals. The animal-fluid interactions are simulated here using a simplified potential flow model of solid spheres migrating vertically in a stably stratified fluid. The interaction of successive solid bodies with each parcel of fluid is shown to lead, under certain conditions, to vertical displacement of the fluid parcels over distances much larger than the individual body size. These regions of displaced fluid are unstably stratified and, hence, amenable to large-scale overturning and efficient mixing.},

  Abstract                 = {Upwelling jets flow alongshore in approximate geostrophic balance with the onshore pressure gradient induced by coastal upwelling. Observations of such jets have shown that they often move offshore downstream of capes, leaving a pool of upwelled water inshore. Comparisons are made between this behavior and the hydraulic transition of a potential-vorticity-conserving coastal current as it passes a topographic anomaly at which it is exactly critical to long coastal-trapped waves. An analytic 1.5-layer model of coastal hydraulics with constant potential vorticity in each layer predicts flow fields (i.e., jet separation) in critical situations that resemble observations. When scales approximate Cape Blanco on the Oregon coast, separation occurs at a jet transport of around 0.76 ? 106 m3 s?1, similar to observed transports. Time-dependent, semigeostrophic calculations suggest that, during an upwelling season, the jet would evolve from a weak flow, which was subcritical everywhere and symmetric about the cape, to an exactly critical state that made a transition from subcritical to supercritical structure at the head of the cape. The predicted flow field at critical transition consists of a narrow upwelling jet upstream of the cape that moves offshore and broadens at the cape. This critical state would be accompanied by a downstream jump back to subcritical conditions. Further upwelling-favorable winds would lead to transient waves that propagated upstream and downstream, modifying the upstream and downstream conditions and restoring criticality. Thus, the head of the cape exerts hydraulic control on the flow and prevents the jet transport from increasing above its critical level. Inherent in the hydraulic approach is the assumption that alongshore scales are large. For realistic alongshore scales, solutions modified by coastline curvature suggest that the convexity of the head of a cape slightly inhibits the transition to a strongly upwelled downstream state by increasing the required critical transport. In the presence of topographic features with finite alongshore scale, the hydraulic approach can be used to construct a flow field, although this flow field has an inherent error arising from the implicit assumptions regarding scales. Estimation of this error for topography representing Cape Blanco suggests that in places the cape is rather abrupt for hydraulic theory to be valid.},

It is shown that small-scale turbulent mixing is present within billows from the early stages of their evolution, but mixing becomes intense and the billows are destroyed as they achieve a maximum height and initiate collapse at a non-dimensional time of , where [Delta]U is the velocity shear and [lambda] is the wavelength. When , the Thorpe scale LT and the maximum Thorpe displacement (LT)max, normalized by the local billow height Lb, are independent of both the horizontal location within the billow and time with and . After the collapse starts, however, the pertinent lengthscale ratios in the [`]core' of the billow show values similar to those of fully developed turbulent patches, i.e., and . The field observations were found to be in good agreement with laboratory-based predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {DYNAMO and TOGA-COARE observations and reanalysis-based surface flux products are used to test theories of atmosphere-ocean interaction that explain the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Negative intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation, indicating deep convective clouds, is in phase with increased surface wind stress, decreased solar heating, and increased surface turbulent heat flux?mostly evaporation?from the ocean to the atmosphere. Net heat flux cools the upper ocean in the convective phase. Sea surface temperature (SST) warms during the suppressed phase, reaching a maximum before the onset of MJO convection. The timing of convection, surface flux, and SST is consistent from the central Indian Ocean (70$\deg$E) to the western Pacific Ocean (160$\deg$E).Mean surface evaporation observed in TOGA COARE and DYNAMO (110 W m?2) accounts for about half of the moisture supply for the mean precipitation (210 W m?2 for DYNAMO). Precipitation maxima are an order of magnitude larger than evaporation anomalies, requiring moisture convergence in the mean, and on intraseasonal and daily time scales. Column-integrated moisture increases 2 cm before the convectively active phase over the research vessel Revelle in DYNAMO, in accord with MJO moisture recharge theory. Local surface evaporation does not significantly recharge the column water budget before convection. As suggested in moisture mode theories, evaporation increases the moist static energy of the column during convection. Rather than simply discharging moisture from the column, the strongest daily precipitation anomalies in the convectively active phase accompany increasing column moisture.},

  Abstract                 = {In February-April 1991, episodes of 2 to 8 m s$-$1 westerly winds of 3 to 11 days' duration occurred in the western Pacific warm pool. Resulting modifications of the upper ocean in current and hydrology are quantified using data from an equatorial mooring at 165$\deg$E and from three cruises within 30 days of one another along 165$\deg$E. During westerly wind bursts (WWB) stronger than 4 m s$-$1, the upper 50 m becomes isothermal to within 0.1$\deg$C and sea surface temperature (SST) drops by 0.3-0.4$\deg$C between 5$\deg$S and 2.5$\deg$N. Conversely, SST starts warming and the upper 50 m restratifies in 4-5 days after the end of WWB. In contrast to previous observations, salinity between 0 and 50 m appears almost unaffected by WWB; it freshens by 0.4 practical salinity unit in March within an area of 1$\deg$-2$\deg$ of latitude around the equator but not necessarily in direct response to WWB. As for zonal circulation, surface equatorial flow accelerates eastward 2-3 days after the beginning of westerlies. Then, after less than 2 weeks, eastward and westward jets both develop from 2$\deg$N to 2$\deg$S in the upper and lower halves of the temperature mixed layer, respectively. Changes in zonal mass transport in this layer were as much as 30 Sv between 2.5$\deg$S and 2.5$\deg$N from one cruise to the next.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates the exchange of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean using data collected from four oceanic field experiments. Direct covariance estimates of momentum fluxes were collected in all four experiments and wind profiles were collected during three of them. The objective of the investigation is to improve parameterizations of the surface roughness and drag coefficient used to estimate the surface stress from bulk formulas. Specifically, the Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) 3.0 bulk flux algorithm is refined to create COARE 3.5. Oversea measurements of dimensionless shear are used to investigate the stability function under stable and convective conditions. The behavior of surface roughness is then investigated over a wider range of wind speeds (up to 25 m s?1) and wave conditions than have been available from previous oversea field studies. The wind speed dependence of the Charnock coefficient $\alpha$ in the COARE algorithm is modified to , where m = 0.017 m?1 s and b = ?0.005. When combined with a parameterization for smooth flow, this formulation gives better agreement with the stress estimates from all of the field programs at all winds speeds with significant improvement for wind speeds over 13 m s?1. Wave age? and wave slope?dependent parameterizations of the surface roughness are also investigated, but the COARE 3.5 wind speed?dependent formulation matches the observations well without any wave information. The available data provide a simple reason for why wind speed?, wave age?, and wave slope?dependent formulations give similar results?the inverse wave age varies nearly linearly with wind speed in long-fetch conditions for wind speeds up to 25 m s?1.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a linear model of intraseasonal oscillations produced by the interaction of an atmosphere on an equatorial Beta-plane with a fixed ocean. Convection is treated as a means of rapidly redistributing in the vertical heat acquired from the sea surface, rather than as a heat source in and of itself. The model produces a spectrum of equatorially trapped oscillating instabilities, among which is an eastward-propagating wavenumber 1 disturbance with an intrinsic phase speed in the range of 4?20 m s?1, depending on the mean zonal wind, the surface exchange coefficients, the air-sea equivalent potential temperature difference, and the difference of absolute temperature across the depth of the lower troposphere. The three-dimensional structure of this mode is in excellent agreement with observations and recent numerical experiments concerning the 30?60 day oscillation. The phase speed and growth rate of the disturbances depend only on conditions at the equator, while their meridional structure varies with meridional gradients of mean zonal wind, sea surface temperature, and the depth of the moist convective layer. Momentum fluxes by the waves may serve to maintain mean easterlies at the equator. The model also predicts nongeostrophic oscillations with generally shorter periods of around one week.},

  Abstract                 = {Two volume control methods are used to analyze the upper ocean heat and salt balances in response to a westerly wind burst event in the western equatorial Pacific during the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment. One method uses a fixed-thickness surface layer, and the other uses an isopycnal depth as the lower boundary. Horizontal advection terms in the budget calculations are estimated using the R/V Wecoma repeat hydrographic survey data within a 133 km × 133 km region. In both methods, the upper ocean heat budget is balanced within 10 W m−2 of the surface air-sea flux observations during a 19-day time period, which covers the December 1992 westerly wind burst and a low-wind recovery period in early January 1993. The standard error in the estimation of heat advection is 11 W m−2. The salt budget yields a rain rate estimate of 15.4 mmd−1 with an error bar of 4 mmd−1. This estimate is within 20% of the optical rain gauge measurements. The advection terms are important in both the heat and salt balances. Meridional advection dominates over zonal and vertical advection, acting to decrease temperature and increase salinity in the surface layer. From the isopycnal boundary method, the diapycnal turbulent flux transports a mean heat flux of 17 W m−2 into the thermocline. Diapycnal advection is almost equally important, so that the total heat flux into the thermocline is estimated to be more than 30 W m−2 during the study time period. Both terms are also important in the salt budget.},

  Abstract                 = {The hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations for the upper layers of the ocean are solved by expanding the variables in Fourier series and by making use of the mean field approximation. Solar radiation heating is introduced as a time-dependent source term in the heat conduction equation, and surface cooling processes are represented by a constant heat flux out of the top of the ocean. Wind mixing is represented by eddy coefficients of viscosity and conductivity. The calculations show that convection is inhibited by the solar radiation during the day, but usually soon after sunset the water column became unstable, and convection took place near the sea surface. As night progressed, the convection penetrated more deeply until nearly isothermal conditions in the upper layers prevailed. The convection ceased soon after sunrise. The horizontal spacing of convection cells increased with increasing eddy coefficients. When the eddy coefficients became very large, convection did not take place. The turbidity of the water had only a slight effect on the convection process.},

  Abstract                 = {Microscale variability of phytoplankton has been detected in vertical profiles in the ocean for decades, yet its mechanism of formation remains unclear. Here a mechanism is presented which can generate thin (10s of centimeters) layers of phytoplankton through the interaction of near-inertial wave shear with horizontal (along-isopycnal) patchiness of phytoplankton. Horizontal biomass patches along isopycnals are advected over each other by the vertical shear of near-inertial waves, generating layers in vertical profiles. The thickness of the phytoplankton layers can be much less than the vertical wavelength of the internal wave, due to tilting and stretching of horizontal patches of phytoplankton. The thickness of the layers is directly related to the vertical shear and the along-isopycnal scale of the phytoplankton patches: shorter horizontal scales generate thinner layers for a given shear. The amplitude of the biomass difference between layers is directly proportional to both the along-isopycnal and vertical biomass gradients. The model predicts the thickness, time of occurrence and duration of layers during the internal wave's cycle. This mechanism is likely a ubiquitous feature of the world's ocean, and would be particularly important in regions of strong horizontal gradients of properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Models for the evolution of the surface mixed layer need to be improved to include dominant processes such as Langmuir circulation. It is shown that the wave forcing in Langmuir circulation models is much stronger than that due to a surface buoyancy loss, and studies of the erosion by the cells of a pre-existing stratification are described. Mixed layer models will also need to allow for horizontal inhomogeneity. It is shown, for example, that the horizontal buoyancy gradient that may be left behind after a storm produces restratification that can be significant. The nonlinearity of the equation of state is another real-world factor; it gives rise to an annual average surface buoyancy that is misleading as it is compensated by interior cabbeling. Current work linking the mixed layer to water mass formation is also introduced.},

As in previous studies, the dissipation rate of TKE is found to be higher in the wavy ocean surface boundary layer than it would be in a flow past a rigid boundary with similar stress and buoyancy forcing. Estimates of the terms in the turbulent kinetic energy equation indicate that, unlike in a flow past a rigid boundary, the dissipation rates cannot be balanced by local production terms, suggesting that the transport of TKE is important in the ocean surface boundary layer. A simple analytic model containing parameterizations of production, dissipation, and transport reproduces key features of the vertical profile of TKE, including enhancement near the surface. The effective turbulent diffusion coefficient for heat is larger than would be expected in a rigid-boundary boundary layer. This diffusion coefficient is predicted reasonably well by a model that contains the effects of shear production, buoyancy forcing, and transport of TKE (thought to be related to wave breaking). Neglect of buoyancy forcing or wave breaking in the parameterization results in poor predictions of turbulent diffusivity. Langmuir turbulence was detected concurrently with a fraction of the turbulence quantities reported here, but these times did not stand out as having significant differences from observations when Langmuir turbulence was not detected.

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested recently that episodes of westerly wind near the international date line in the western Pacific tend to fall into one of four types. Three of the types have enough equatorial zonal wind variation to be able to induce an eastern Pacific response by forcing equatorial waves. In this note we examine the central and eastern Pacific waveguide response to idealized representations of these three types of westerly wind episodes, using a combination of linear theory and results from an ocean general circulation model. The idealized westerly wind types are the C type (maximum anomalies centered on the equator), the N type (maximum anomalies just north of the equator), and the S type (maximum anomalies just south of the equator). The composite C-type event excites equatorially trapped Kelvin pulses that alter sea surface temperature in the central and eastern Pacific. Warm anomalies caused by the C-type episode have approximately equal contributions from a zonal advection of heat by the Kelvin pulses and a meridional advection of heat by an altered instability wave field. Because the center of forcing of the S-type event is displaced off of the equator, the Kelvin pulses excited by the S-type episode have smaller amplitude than those of the C-type episode, even though the maximum wind anomaly is the same in the two cases. The S-type anomaly also excites weak Rossby-gravity waves that can propagate into the eastern Pacific. Because the Rossby-gravity waves are dispersive, their amplitude diminishes as the waves propagate into the eastern Pacific. The N-type episode, as observed in winds from the western tropical Pacific, is much weaker and of shorter duration than the C and S types, and therefore excites only a very weak eastern Pacific response. Although all types of westerly wind excite a local western Pacific response, only the C- and S-type events excite a significant eastern Pacific response.},

  Abstract                 = {During August 2006 aggregations of nekton, most likely small fish, intersected microstructure survey lines in Monterey Bay, California, providing an opportunity to examine biologically generated mixing. Some aggregations filled the water column, 80 m deep, and extended 100?200 m along the survey track. Others were half that size, and some were much smaller. Acoustic energy backscattered from the aggregations was measured with a calibrated echosounder and yielded volume backscattering strength Sv values of ?80 to ?60 dB re 1 m?1. Turbulent dissipation rates ? were 10?6?10?5 W kg?1 in the more intense aggregations. Within these, ? was much more uniform than turbulence measured outside the aggregations and varied with S?. Three similar aggregations contributed half of the average ? in 142 profiles taken along a 5-km-long survey line during a 12.5-h tidal cycle. Turbulence within aggregations differed markedly from that outside in the following three ways: (i) Thorpe scales, that is, root-mean-square overturning lengths, were much smaller than Ozmidov scales, LOZ $\equiv$ (?/N?3)1/2, the upper limit for overturns limited by stratification. (ii) Spectra of small-scale shear matched the universal shape only in the viscous high-wavenumber rolloff. At lower wavenumbers, the shear spectra had slopes closer to k1 than to the k1/3 Kolmogorov slope with a corresponding velocity spectra peak near 8 cpm. (iii) Temperature gradient spectra matched portions of the universal Batchelor spectrum that could be resolved, but their magnitudes were smaller than those in turbulence produced by flow instabilities. Average mixing efficiency {$\Gamma$} was 0.0022 within aggregations, compared with 0.23 outside. This 100-fold decrease in efficiency compensates for a 100-fold increase in ? to produce no net change in diapycnal diffusivity K?. Because the composition and behavior of the aggregations were not confirmed?that is, whether the nekton had regular spacing and swimming patterns characterizing schools?it is not possible to know whether one or many turbulent states were sampled within aggregations. If these observations are representative, mixing in aggregations may be more interesting than it is important, but the data are too few for definitive conclusions.},

Petrographic study indicates that the pebbles are lithologically similar to a number of rock types exposed along the Columbia River and its tributaries in Oregon and eastern Washington. The catastrophic late Pleistocene glacial floods which scoured this area of the Pacific Northwest transported coarse material derived from these outcrops down the river to the ocean. These catastrophic events are believed to have generated high-velocity and high-density turbidity currents which transported the coarse sediment for many hundreds of kilometers along the sea floor.},

  Abstract                 = {The interactions between boundary layer turbulence, including Langmuir turbulence, and submesoscale processes in the oceanic mixed layer are described using large-eddy simulations of the spindown of a temperature front in the presence of submesoscale eddies, winds, and waves. The simulations solve the surface-wave-averaged Boussinesq equations with Stokes drift wave forcing at a resolution that is sufficiently fine to capture small-scale Langmuir turbulence. A simulation without Stokes drift forcing is also performed for comparison. Spatial and spectral properties of temperature, velocity, and vorticity fields are described, and these fields are scale decomposed in order to examine multiscale fluxes of momentum and buoyancy. Buoyancy flux results indicate that Langmuir turbulence counters the restratifying effects of submesoscale eddies, leading to small-scale vertical transport and mixing that is 4 times greater than in the simulations without Stokes drift forcing. The observed fluxes are also shown to be in good agreement with results from an asymptotic analysis of the surface-wave-averaged, or Craik?Leibovich, equations. Regions of potential instability in the flow are identified using Richardson and Rossby numbers, and it is found that mixed gravitational/symmetric instabilities are nearly twice as prevalent when Langmuir turbulence is present, in contrast to simulations without Stokes drift forcing, which are dominated by symmetric instabilities. Mixed layer depth calculations based on potential vorticity and temperature show that the mixed layer is up to 2 times deeper in the presence of Langmuir turbulence. Differences between measures of the mixed layer depth based on potential vorticity and temperature are smaller in the simulations with Stokes drift forcing, indicating a reduced incidence of symmetric instabilities in the presence of Langmuir turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {The scaling of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and its vertical component (VKE) in the upper ocean boundary layer, forced by realistic wind stress and surface waves including the effects of Langmuir circulations, is investigated using large-eddy simulations (LESs). The interaction of waves and turbulence is modeled by the Craik?Leibovich vortex force. Horizontally uniform surface stress {\oe}{\~{N}}0 and Stokes drift profiles uS(z) are specified from the 10-m wind speed U10 and the surface wave age CP/U10, where CP is the spectral peak phase speed, using an empirical surface wave spectra and an associated wave age?dependent neutral drag coefficient CD. Wave-breaking effects are not otherwise included. Mixed layer depths HML vary from 30 to 120 m, with 0.6 {\quotesinglbase}{\^{a}}{\S} CP/U10 {\quotesinglbase}{\^{a}}{\S} 1.2 and 8 m s?1 < U10 < 70 m s?1, thereby addressing most possible oceanic conditions where TKE production is dominated by wind and wave forcing. The mixed layer?averaged ?bulk? VKE ?w2?/u*2 is equally sensitive to the nondimensional Stokes e-folding depth D*S/HML and to the turbulent Langmuir number Lat = u*/US, where u* = |{\oe}{\~{N}}0|/?w in water density ?w and US = |uS|z=0. Use of a D*S scale-equivalent monochromatic wave does not accurately reproduce the results using a full-surface wave spectrum with the same e-folding depth. The bulk VKE for both monochromatic and broadband spectra is accurately predicted using a surface layer (SL) Langmuir number LaSL = u*/?uS?SL, where ?uS?SL is the average Stokes drift in a surface layer 0 > z > ? 0.2HML relative to that near the bottom of the mixed layer. In the wave-dominated limit LaSL ? 0, turbulent vertical velocity scales as wrms ? u*La?2/3SL. The mean profile (z) of VKE is characterized by a subsurface peak, the depth of which increases with D*S/HML to a maximum near 0.22HML as its relative magnitude /?w2? decreases. Modestly accurate scalings for these variations are presented. The magnitude of the crosswind velocity convergence scales differently from VKE. These results predict that for pure wind seas and HML ? 50 m, ?w2?/u*2 varies from less than 1 for young waves at U10 = 10 m s?1 to about 2 for mature seas at winds greater than U10 = 30 m s?1. Preliminary comparisons with Lagrangian float data account for invariance in ?w2?/u*2 measurements as resulting from an inverse relationship between U10 and CP/U10 in observed regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {The infinitesimal stability of inviscid, parallel, stratified shear flows to two-dimensional disturbances is described by the Taylor-Goldstein equation. Instability can only occur when the Richardson number is less than 1\&sol;4 somewhere in the flow. We consider cases where the Richardson number is everywhere non- negative. The eigenvalue problem is expressed in terms of four parameters, J a \&lsquo;typical\&rsquo; Richardson number, \&alpha; the (real) wavenumber and c the complex phase speed of the disturbance. Two computer programs are developed to integrate the stability equation and to solve for eigenvalues: the first finds c given \&alpha; and J, the second finds \&alpha; and J when c \&equiv; 0 (i.e. it computes the stationary neutral curve for the flow). This is sometimes, but not always, the stability boundary in the \&alpha;, J plane. The second program works only for cases where the velocity and density profiles are antisymmetric about the velocity inflexion point. By means of these two programs, several configurations of velocity and density have been investigated, both of the free-shear-layer type and the jet type. Calculations of temporal growth rates for particular profiles have been made.},

  Abstract                 = {An improved method for estimating the directional spectrum of linear surface gravity waves from in Situ observations is presented. The technique, a refinement and extension of the inverse method of Long and Hasselmann, is applicable to multicomponent wave measurements at fixed locations in constant or slowly varying depth water. On a frequency band by frequency band basis, an estimate of the directional distribution of wave energy S(?) is obtained by minimizing a roughness measure of the form ?d?[d2S(?)/d?2]2 subject to the constraints: (i) S(?) is nonnegative with unit integral, (ii) S(?) fits the data within a chosen statistical confidence level, and (iii) S(?) is zero on any directional sectors where energy levels are always relatively low because of the influence of geographic surroundings. The solution to this inverse problem is derived through a variational formulation with Lagrange multipliers. A series of simulations using the new estimator show the fundamental limitations of sparse array data and the importance of using all available data-independent information [i.e., constraints (i) and (iii)] for achieving optimal estimates. The advantages of smoothness optimization are illustrated in a comparison of the present and Long and Hasselmann methods. The present method yields smooth estimates where Long and Hasselmann obtained rough estimates with multiple spurious peaks. A smooth solution to the inverse problem that has only truly resolved features is both easier to interpret and more readily evaluated numerically than wildly spurious solutions. The examples also demonstrate the subjectivity of intercomparing estimation techniques. A few illustrative examples are presented of S(?) estimates obtained from a two-dimensional array (aperture 120 m ? 96 m) of 14 pressure transducer in 6 m water depth. Estimates using the full array and no geographic constraints are smooth and exhibit the expected refractive columnation of shoreward propagating energy towards normal incidence. Additionally, reflection from the mildly sloping beach 310 m shoreward of the center of this array is very weak at wind wave and swell frequencies. Estimates of S(?) made using only the sensors on a longshore line, and a constraint of no reflected energy, are very similar to S(?) obtained with the full array and no constraint.},

  Abstract                 = { When a suspension of bacterial cells of the species Bacillus subtilis is placed in a chamber with its upper surface open to the atmosphere complex bioconvection patterns are observed. These arise because the cells: (1) are denser than water; and (2) usually swim upwards, so that the density of an initially uniform suspension becomes greater at the top than the bottom. When the vertical density gradient becomes large enough, an overturning instability occurs which ultimately evolves into the observed patterns. The reason that the cells swim upwards is that they are aerotactic, i.e. they swim up gradients of oxygen, and they consume oxygen. These properties are incorporated in conservation equations for the cell (N) and oxygen (C) concentrations, and these are solved in the pre-instability phase of development when N and C depend only on the vertical coordinate and time. Numerical results are obtained for both shallow- and deep-layer chambers, which are intrinsically different and require different mathematical and numerical treatments. It is found that, for both shallow and deep chambers, a thin boundary layer, densely packed with cells, forms near the surface. Beneath this layer the suspension becomes severely depleted of cells. Furthermore, in the deep chamber cases, a discontinuity in the cell concentration arises between this cell-depleted region and a cell-rich region further below, where no significant oxygen concentration gradients develop before the oxygen is fully consumed. The results obtained from the model are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.},

  Abstract                 = {To explore new mechanisms for planktonic thin layer formation, particle and continuum models of gyrotactically swimming phytoplankton are embedded in simulations of a dynamically unstable stratified shear layer. Two trapping mechanisms are observed in the developing Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) billow train. Within the K-H billows, a particle can remain preferentially in downwelling regions, cancelling its upward swimming motion. In the braids that separate the billows, intense shear defeats the gyrotactic stabilization mechanism and causes cells to tumble. Particle and continuum models are compared statistically to reveal both consistencies and weaknesses in each. A scaling based on Reynolds number and swimming speed is used to predict the maximum concentration generated by an instability event. Although K-H billows are short lived in comparison with planktonic thin layers observed in the coastal oceans, the resulting trapping causes rapid aggregation. We conclude that trapping in a growing K-H instability could contribute to the development of the observed cell concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that the Craik-Leibovich (CL) theory of Langmuir circulation in an ideal incompressible fluid driven by rapidly fluctuating surface waves due to the wind may be formulated in terms of Eulerian mean fluid variables as a Hamiltonian system. This formulation is facilitated by first determining Hamilton's principle for the \{CL\} equations. The \{CL\} Hamilton's principle is similar to that for a fluid plasma, driven by a rapidly varying external electromagnetic field via ``J � A'' minimal coupling, after averaging the plasma action over the fast phase of the (single frequency) driving field. This similarity leads to a precise analogy between the \{CL\} vortex force and the Lorentz force on an electrically charged fluid due to an exernally imposed electromagnetic field. We determine the effect of this force on the inflection point criterion and the Richardson number criterion for stability of planar \{CL\} flows. The Noether symmetries of Hamilton's principle for the \{CL\} equations (under fluid particle relabeling) lead to conservation laws for Eulerian mean potential vorticity and helicity, and generate the steady Eulerian mean flows as canonical transformations. The generalized Lagrangian mean theory is discussed from the same viewpoint.},

  Abstract                 = {Mixing efficiency between different water masses is typically assumed to be constant in diapycnal mixing parameterizations used in ocean models. As of now, most coarse resolution ocean circulation models employ a constant mixing efficiency value of 0.2 for the shear driven mixing, internal waves and bottom boundary layer parameterizations. This study investigates the energetics and mixing efficiency of the lock-exchange flow at different Reynolds numbers. The lock-exchange experiment resolves Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices and is an idealized test case for oceanic gravity currents. At first, the required spatial resolution for the direct numerical simulations (DNS) is determined in simulations at a constant Reynolds number of 3500. The evolution of background potential energy and tracer variance are used to assess model results. We found that the model spatial resolution should resolve at least the Kolmogorov scale but not necessarily the Batchelor scale if convergences of background potential energy, tracer variance and dissipation are considered. Simulations at Reynolds number of 125, 500, 1000, 2500, 3500, 5000, 6000, 10000 show that the mixing efficiency in the lock-exchange flow is smaller than 0.2 , and it saturates around 0.12 when Reynolds numbers exceed the value of 2500.},

  Abstract                 = { The diffusive behaviour of swimming micro-organisms should be clarified in order to obtain a better continuum model for cell suspensions. In this paper, a swimming micro-organism is modelled as a squirming sphere with prescribed tangential surface velocity, in which the centre of mass of the sphere may be displaced from the geometric centre (bottom-heaviness). Effects of inertia and Brownian motion are neglected, because real micro-organisms swim at very low Reynolds numbers but are too large for Brownian effects to be important. The three-dimensional movement of 64 or 27 identical squirmers in a fluid otherwise at rest, contained in a cube with periodic boundary conditions, is dynamically computed, for random initial positions and orientations. The computation utilizes a database of pairwise interactions that has been constructed by the boundary element method. In the case of (non-bottom-heavy) squirmers, both the translational and the orientational spreading of squirmers is correctly described as a diffusive process over a sufficiently long time scale, even though all the movements of the squirmers were deterministically calculated. Scaling of the results on the assumption that the squirmer trajectories are unbiased random walks is shown to capture some but not all of the main features of the results. In the case of (bottom-heavy) squirmers, the diffusive behaviour in squirmers' orientations can be described by a biased random walk model, but only when the effect of hydrodynamic interaction dominates that of the bottom-heaviness. The spreading of bottom-heavy squirmers in the horizontal directions show diffusive behaviour, and that in the vertical direction also does when the average upward velocity is subtracted. The rotational diffusivity in this case, at a volume fraction c=0.1, is shown to be at least as large as that previously measured in very dilute populations of swimming algal cells (Chlamydomonas nivalis). },

  Abstract                 = {We apply a one-dimensional mixed layer model, based on second moment closure of turbulence, to study the effects of surface gravity waves on mixing in the oceanic mixed layer. The turbulent kinetic energy injected near the surface by breaking waves, and the kinetic energy input from Langmuir circulations that may exist in the presence of surface gravity waves, are both parameterized and included in the turbulence model. As expected, the wave breaking elevates both the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate in the upper few meters, well above the classical values expected from similarity theory for shear layers adjacent to a boundary. While there is a significant impact on mixed layer properties near the surface, wave breaking-induced turbulence decays rapidly with distance from the surface and hence the overall effects on the mixed layer are small. On the other hand, the energy input to turbulence from Langmuir cells elevates the turbulent kinetic energy and mixing throughout the mixed layer, and is therefore more effective in deepening the mixed layer. While the changes in sea surface temperature (SST) brought about by the inclusion of Langmuir cells are rather small on diurnal time scales, they can be appreciable over seasonal time scales. Nevertheless, these SST changes are well within the uncertainties in the modeled SST resulting from an imperfect knowledge of the air-sea fluxes used to drive the mixed layer models.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method is introduced for determining ocean isothermal layer depth (ILD) from temperature profiles and ocean mixed layer depth (MLD) from density profiles that can be applied in all regions of the world's oceans. This method can accommodate not only in situ data but also climatological data sets that typically have much lower vertical resolution. The sensitivity of the ILD and MLD to the temperature difference criteria used in the surface layer depth definition is discussed by using temperature and density data, respectively: (1) from 11 ocean weather stations in the northeast Pacific and (2) from the World Ocean Atlas 1994. Using these two data sets, a detailed statistical error analysis is presented for the ILD and MLD estimation by season. MLD variations with location due to temperature and salinity are properly accounted for in the defining density ({$\Delta$}$\sigma$t) criterion. Overall, the optimal estimate of turbulent mixing penetration is obtained using a MLD definition of {$\Delta$}T =0.8$\deg$0, although in the northeast Pacific region the optimal MLD criterion is found to vary seasonally. The method is shown to produce layer depths that are accurate to within 20 m or better in 85% or more of the cases. The MLD definition presented in this investigation accurately represents the depth to which turbulent mixing has penetrated and would be a useful aid for validation of one-dimensional bulk mixed layer models and ocean general circulation models with an embedded mixed layer.},

A coupled wind?wave model is developed based on the assumption that in the equilibrium range of surface wave spectra the wind stress is dominated by the form drag of breaking waves. By conserving both momentum and energy in the air and also imposing the wave energy balance, coupled equations are derived governing the turbulent stress, wind speed, and the breaking-wave distribution (total breaking crest length per unit surface area as a function of wavenumber). It is assumed that smaller-scale breaking waves are sheltered from wind forcing if they are in airflow separation regions of longer breaking waves (spatial sheltering effect).

In both cases, the breaking-wave distribution approaches a constant value for large wavenumbers (small-scale breakers).

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing evidence that the Madden?Julian oscillation (MJO) modifies the mid- to high-latitude circulation and, in particular, appears to have a relationship to the leading mode of extratropical variability, the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In this study, new insights into the observed similarities between the MJO and the AO are explored. It is shown that the eastward progression of the convectively active phase of the MJO is associated with a corresponding shift in the tendency and sign of the AO index. Moreover, the AO and the MJO share several analogous features not only in the global circulation, but also in surface temperature fields. Also, the AO is linked to a pattern of eastward-propagating MJO-like variability in the tropics that is partially reproduced in free runs of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) model. Finally, it is shown that the structure of the AO, as defined by the leading mode in the 1000-hPa geopotential height field, is significantly altered based on the phase of the MJO.},

  Abstract                 = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal “K profile parameterization” (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, Rρ. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969-1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.},

Drag coefficients from 196 Reynolds flux measurements agree well with those reported in Smith (1980) based on independent observations at the same site. Based on 192 runs, a comparison of the dissipation and Reynolds flux results shows excellent agreement on average, for wind speeds from 4 to 20 m s?1. The much more extensive dissipation data set (1086 h from the tower and 505 h from the weathership PAPA, CCGS Quadra) was used to investigate the dependence of the drag coefficient on wind speed, fetch and stability. The drag coefficient reduced to 10 m height and neutral conditions (CDN), is independent of stability and fetch (for fetch/height ?800) but increases with wind speed above 10 m s?1. Some time series of the momentum flux and drag coefficient are shown to demonstrate additional sources of variation in the drag coefficient. CDN is observed to be smaller, on average. during rising winds than during failing winds or after a change in wind direction. Based on our results and many deep water results of others, we obtainwhere U10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m. A method for calculating the stress from this CDN and observations of wind speed and surface minus air temperature at heights other than 10 m is also given.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of acoustic scattering from zooplankton and oceanic microstructure using a broadband echosounder. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 379?394. In principle, measurements of high-frequency acoustic scattering from oceanic microstructure and zooplankton across a broad range of frequencies can reduce the ambiguities typically associated with the interpretation of acoustic scattering at a single frequency or a limited number of discrete narrowband frequencies. With this motivation, a high-frequency broadband scattering system has been developed for investigating zooplankton and microstructure, involving custom modifications of a commercially available system, with almost complete acoustic coverage spanning the frequency range 150?600 kHz. This frequency range spans the Rayleigh-to-geometric scattering transition for some zooplankton, as well as the diffusive roll-off in the spectrum for scattering from turbulent temperature microstructure. The system has been used to measure scattering from zooplankton and microstructure in regions of non-linear internal waves. The broadband capabilities of the system provide a continuous frequency response of the scattering over a wide frequency band, and improved range resolution and signal-to-noise ratios through pulse-compression signal-processing techniques. System specifications and calibration procedures are outlined and the system performance is assessed. The results point to the utility of high-frequency broadband scattering techniques in the detection, classification, and under certain circumstances, quantification of zooplankton and microstructure.},

Six quantities were calculated to characterize each hourly sea state: omnidirectional wave power, significant wave height, energy period, spectral width, direction of the maximum directionally resolved wave power and directionality coefficient. The temporal variability of these characteristic quantities is depicted at different scales and is seen to be considerable. The mean wave power during the winter months was found to be up to 7 times that of the summer mean. Winter energy flux also tends to have a longer energy period, a narrower spectral width, and a reduced directional spread, when compared to summer months. Locations closer to shore, where the mean water depth is less than 50{~}m, tended to exhibit lower omnidirectional wave power, but were more uniform directionally. Cumulative distributions of both occurrence and contribution to total energy are presented, over each of the six quantities characterizing the resource. It is clear that the sea states occurring most often are not necessarily those that contribute most to the total incident wave energy. The sea states with the greatest contribution to energy have significant wave heights between 2 and 5{~}m and energy periods between 8 and 12{~}s. Sea states with the greatest significant wave heights (e.g.&gt;7{~}m) contribute little to the annual energy, but are critically important when considering reliability and survivability of ocean wave energy converters.},

  Abstract                 = {A large eddy simulation (LES) model is used to examine how buoyancy-driven thermal convection, wind-driven shear turbulence and wind/wave-driven Langmuir circulation compete to generate turbulence in the ocean surface mixed layer. The turbulent Langmuir number Lat, a ratio of friction velocity to surface Stokes drift velocity, and the Hoenikker number Ho, a ratio of buoyancy forcing to wave forcing, are two controlling dimensionless parameters. We explore low-order turbulence statistics in the Lat and Ho parameter space for a wide range of atmospheric forcing conditions and construct a regime diagram to differentiate buoyancy-, shear- and wave-driven turbulence. All three types of turbulent flows are anisotropic but show different orderings of turbulence intensities: vertical &gt; (downwind, crosswind) in convective turbulence; downwind&gt;crosswind&gt;vertical in shear turbulence; crosswind $\approx$ vertical&gt; downwind in Langmuir turbulence. These orderings of turbulence intensities can be explained by examining the turbulence energy production in three directions. Buoyancy production in the vertical direction dominates turbulence generation in convective turbulence, whereas shear production in the downwind direction dominates turbulence generation in shear-driven turbulence. In Langmuir turbulence, however, Stokes production due to surface waves generates turbulence energy in both crosswind and vertical directions.},

  Abstract                 = {A 38-day, 5990-cast microstructure study on the equator performed during the onset of the 1991-1993 El Niño shows the effect on small-scale activity at 140°W of an equatorial Kelvin wave. By using two ships, data were taken continuously from November 4 to December 12, 1991, near the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory mooring at O°N, 140°W. The ships occupied the station sequentially with a 3.5-day overlap for intercalibration. Variability in currents was observed on tidal periods, and periods of 4 days (presumably equatorially trapped internal gravity waves), 8 days (cause unknown), 20 days (tropical instability waves), and longer (Kelvin waves). Variation in water structure occurred most prominently on the timescale of Kelvin waves. The diurnal cycle typical of that location was observed: nocturnal deepening of the surface mixed layer was accompanied by a “deep cycle,” bursts of turbulence penetrating into the stratified region below the nighttime mixed layer. During the observational period, one Kelvin wave trough and one crest passed through the site. Changes accompanying the phase change in the Kelvin wave included a reversal of the near-surface current, a deepening of the thermocline, and a change of water mass. Changes in small-scale activity included a tenfold decrease of the thermal dissipation rate and a fourfold decrease of the rate of heat transport downward from the mixed layer. The nighttime mixed layer deepened from 30 to 60 m. The thickness of the stratified region in which nocturnal turbulence bursts occurred, the deep cycle region, thinned from 40 to 20 m because it was confined between the bottom of the nighttime mixed layer and the low-shear region near the core of the undercurrent. The decrease in downward heat flux observed at this passage of the downwelling Kelvin wave front could explain the rapid sea surface temperature (SST) increase seen at El Nino onsets. The magnitude of the change in vertical flux is similar to the magnitude of the change in horizontal advection. This process would produce a warmer SST much more quickly than could the advection of warm waters eastward.},

  Abstract                 = {It was shown by Stokes that in a water wave the particles of fluid possess, apart from their orbital motion, a steady second-order drift velocity (usually called the mass-transport velocity). Recent experiments, however, have indicated that the mass-transport velocity can be very different from that predicted by Stokes on the assumption of a perfect, non-viscous fluid. In this paper a general theory of mass transport is developed, which takes account of the viscosity, and leads to results in agreement with observation. Part I deals especially with the interior of the fluid. It is shown that the nature of the motion in the interior depends upon the ratio of the wave amplitude a to the thickness δ of the boundary layer: when a2/δ 2 is small the diffusion of vorticity takes place by viscous 'conduction'; when a2/δ 2 is large, by convection with the mass-transport velocity. Appropriate field equations for the stream function of the mass transport are derived. The boundary layers, however, require separate consideration. In part II special attention is given to the boundary layers, and a general theory is developed for two types of oscillating boundary: when the velocities are prescribed at the boundary, and when the stresses are prescribed. Whenever the motion is simple-harmonic the equations of motion can be integrated exactly. A general method is described for determining the mass transport throughout the fluid in the presence of an oscillating body, or with an oscillating stress at the boundary. In part III, the general method of solution described in parts I and II is applied to the cases of a progressive and a standing wave in water of uniform depth. The solutions are markedly different from the perfect-fluid solutions with irrotational motion. The chief characteristic of the progressive-wave solution is a strong forward velocity near the bottom. The predicted maximum velocity near the bottom agrees well with that observed by Bagnold.},

  Abstract                 = {The mixed layer of the western equatorial Pacific and its thermodynamics are poorly known because of a general lack of data. Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles from the recent Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation Study (WEPOCS) cruises have been analyzed for various measures of the upper layer and mixed layer thickness, using criteria which depend on vertical gradients of temperature, salinity, and density. From 434 profiles, the average mixed layer depth in the western equatorial Pacific during the two WEPOCS cruises was 29 m, which is about a factor of 3 shallower than had previously been thought. The mean depth of the top of the thermocline was found to be 64 m, so there is a nearly isothermal layer that is deeper than the mixed layer. This discrepancy is attributable to salinity stratification. It is hypothesized that the waters in this {\textquotedblleft}barrier{\textquotedblright} layer between the bottom of the mixed layer and the top of the thermocline are formed to the east of the WEPOCS region, and subducted below the shallow and lighter mixed layer waters found in the west. Under light wind conditions, there was a tendency for warm and thin layers to form at the sea surface as a result of diurnal heating; however, there did not appear to be any nighttime maximum to the mixed layer depth associated with convective overturn due to cooling. This contrast with the central Pacific may be caused by the influence of salinity on the thermodynamics of the mixed layer. A strong westerly wind burst was observed during WEPOCS II, and apparently the mixed layer nearly doubled in depth while cooling by more than 1$\deg$C. Evidence of downwelling near the equator, and upwelling off the equator, was seen in the distribution of temperature, salinity, and density in the meridional section along 143$\deg$E, which was occupied immediately following the wind event. This event was apparently strong enough to erode through the salinity-stratified layer and into the thermocline, resulting in the observed cooling. The results of this study suggest that except during strong wind events, entrainment cooling may not be an important component of the heat budget of the western Pacific warm pool. This has potentially important implications for the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.},

  Abstract                 = { To investigate the formation mechanism of energy spectra of internal waves in the oceans, direct numerical simulations are performed. The simulations are based on the reduced dynamical equations of rotating stratified turbulence. In the reduced dynamical equations only wave modes are retained, and vortices and horizontally uniform vertical shears are excluded. Despite the simplifications, our simulations reproduce some key features of oceanic internal-wave spectra: accumulation of energy at near-inertial waves and realistic frequency and horizontal wavenumber dependencies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that formation of the energy spectra in the inertial subrange is dominated by scale-separated interactions with the near-inertial waves. These findings support observationally based intuition that spectral energy density of internal waves is the result of predominantly wave-wave interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Rainfall over the ocean is one of the most important climatic parameters for both oceanic and atmospheric science. Traditional accumulation-type rain gauges are difficult to operate at sea, and so an alternate technique using underwater sound has been developed. The technique of passive monitoring of the ocean rainfall using ambient sound depends on the accuracy of sound pressure level (SPL) detection. Consequently, absolute calibration of the hydrophone is desirable, but is difficult to achieve because typically the geometry of the laboratory calibration process does not fit the measurement geometry over the ocean. However, if one assumes that the sound signal that is generated by wind is universal then the wind signal can be used to provide an absolute calibration. Over 90 buoy months of ambient sound spectra have been collected on the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) project array since 1998. By applying the Vagle et al. wind speed algorithm, the instrument noises and sensitivity bias for the absolute calibration of each acoustic rain gauge (ARG) are obtained. An acoustic discrimination process is developed to retrieve the pure geophysical signals. A new single-frequency rainfall-rate algorithm is proposed after comparing the ARG data with R.M. Young self-siphoning rain gauge data, collocated on the same moorings. The acoustic discrimination process and the rainfall algorithm are further tested at two other locations and are compared with R.M. Young rain gauges and the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) product 3B42. The acoustic rainfall accumulations show the comparable results in both long (year) and short (hours) time scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Long time series (5?10 years) of station pressure and upper air data from stations located in the tropics are subjected to spectral and cross-spectral analysis to investigate the spatial extent of a previously detected oscillation in various variables with a period range of 40?50 days. In addition, time series of station pressure from two tropical stations for the 1890's are examined and indicate that the oscillation is a stationary feature. The cross-spectral analysis suggests that the oscillation is of global scale but restricted to the tropics: it possesses features of an eastward-moving wave whose characteristics change with time. A mean wave disturbance, constructed with data from the IGY, provides additional descriptive material on the spatial and temporal behavior of the oscillation. The manifestation in station pressure consists of anomalies which appear between 10N and 10S in the Indian Ocean region and propagate eastward to the Eastern Pacific. Zonal winds participate in the oscillation and, in general, are out-of-phase between the upper and lower troposphere. Mixing ratios and temperatures are also investigated. The sum total of evidence indicates that the oscillation is the result of an eastward movement of large-scale circulation cells oriented in the equatorial (zonal) plane.},

  Abstract                 = {Nearly ten years of daily rawinsonde data for Canton Island (3S, 172W) have been subjected to spectrum and cross-spectrum analysis. In the course of this analysis a very pronounced maximum was noted in the co-spectrum of the 850- and 150-mb zonal wind components in the frequency range 0.0245?0.0190 day?1 (41?53 days period). Application of a posteriori sampling theory resulted in a significance level of ?6% (0.1% prior confidence level). This type of significance test is appropriate because no prior evidence or reason existed for expecting such a spectral feature. Subsequent analysis revealed the following structure of the oscillation. Peaks in the variance spectra of the zonal wind are strong in the low troposphere, are weak or non-existent in the 700?400 mb layer, and are strong again in the upper troposphere. No evidence of this feature could be found above 80 mb, or in any of the spectra of the meridional component. The spectrum of station pressure possesses a peak in this frequency range and the oscillation is in phase with the low tropospheric zonal wind oscillation, and out of phase with that in the upper troposphere. The tropospheric temperatures exhibit a similar peak and are highly coherent with the station pressure oscillation; positive station pressure anomalies are associated with negative temperature anomalies throughout the troposphere. Thus, the lower-middle troposphere appears to be a nodal surface with u and P oscillating in phase but 180$\deg$ out of phase above and below this surface. Evidence for this phenomenon was found in shorter records at Kwajalein (9N, 168E) but not at Singapore (1N, 104E) or Balboa, Canal Zone (9N, 79w). We speculate that the oscillation is a large circulation cell oriented in zonal planes and centered in the mid-Pacific.},

The analysis is applied to data collected at a tower 2 km off the coast of Denmark during the Ris{\o} Air Sea Experiment (RASEX). Various flux sampling problems are evaluated to eliminate unreliable fluxes. Large drag coefficients are observed with weak large-scale flow. However, the value of the computed drag coefficient at weak wind speeds is sensitive to flux sampling problems and the method of calculation of the drag coefficient, which might be a general characteristic of weak winds. The drag coefficient is significantly larger for short fetch conditions, particularly at strong wind speeds.},

The algorithm is motivated by multiple scale asymptotic analysis of the master partial differential (Navier-Stokes-like) equations and comprises coupled equation sets for the fine- and coarse-scale dynamics. A primary virtue of the resulting multiscale formulation is that dynamical teleconnections between the fine and coarse scales are explicitly identified and computed, enabling fewer fine-scale domains than coarse-scale grid points to be used. Quantitative comparisons between the multiscale simulations and direct numerical simulations of the master partial differential equations are made. Good agreement is demonstrated in the appropriate parameter regime at a cost that is orders of magnitude less than that required for brute-force simulations using the single-scale algorithm. Several novel multiscale physical interactions are identified, highlighting the utility of the algorithm and the potential importance of spatiotemporal modulation of the convective flow on the mean dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Intensive observations, using an array of surface and subsurface moored buoys, are conducted around 80.5$\deg$E in the equatorial Indian Ocean during October/November 2006. An intriguing data set of atmospheric and oceanic variables during a peak phase of a positive Indian Ocean Dipole is obtained. The ocean observation data shows relatively shallow thermocline, which intensifies with time during the one-month period, and eastward subsurface zonal flow under westward flowing surface current, generating unusually strong vertical shear above the thermocline. Intraseasonal meridional current variability is also observed. Upper-ocean volume budget analysis indicates that a strong upwelling event, larger than 10 m/day, and associated upward movement of the isotherms below the thermocline occur for a few days in early November. These observed data demonstrates unusual conditions of the upper ocean during boreal autumn in 2006.},

  Abstract                 = {Several 5 to 10 m s−1 westerly wind bursts of 10-15 days' duration occurred in the western equatorial Pacific during November 1989 to January 1990. The response to these wind bursts was characterized by a 400- to 600-km-wide eastward jet in the upper 100-150 m along the equator between 135°E and the date line. Flow in this jet accelerated to speeds of over 100 cm s−1 within 1 week after the onset of westerly winds in November 1989 in association with supertyphoon Irma. In addition, a 20 to 40 cm s−1 westward counterflow developed between 2°N and 2°S below the surface jet separating it from the eastward flow of the Equatorial Undercurrent in the thermocline. Changes in surface layer zonal volume transports in the western Pacific due to westerly wind bursts were 25-56 Sv based on comparison of three shipboard velocity transects in November and December 1989. Although fluctuations in current speeds in the thermocline were generally smaller and less directly related to local wind forcing than those in the surface layer, the Equatorial Undercurrent decelerated to less than 20 cm s−1 (i.e., less than half its speed before the onset of westerlies) by early December 1989. Westerly winds also produced a strong surface convergence in both the meridional and zonal directions west of the date line. In late November 1989, this convergence was associated with downwelling of 2-3 m d−1 along the equator, and a 20- to 30-m depression of the thermocline. In addition, sea level rose by 10 dyn cm from mid-November to mid-December between 1°S and 3°N, 165°E. Sea surface temperature dropped over a large region by 0.2°-0.5°C during episodes of high westerly winds, and some episodes of high winds were associated with 0.2°-0.3°C sea surface temperature inversions supported by salt-stratified buoyancy gradients in the upper 100 m. The near-surface salinity balance was dominated by lateral advection when relatively fresh water from north of a salinity front centered near 3°N was advected southward by Ekman drift in late November 1989. Displacement of this front past a current meter mooring at 0°, 165°E, appeared as a local drop of 1 psu in surface layer salinity in 10 days. These results are discussed in the context of a swing in the climate system towards El Niño-Southern Oscillation-like conditions in early 1990.},

  Abstract                 = {The Indian Ocean is unique among the three tropical ocean basins in that it is blocked at 25$\deg$N by the Asian landmass. Seasonal heating and cooling of the land sets the stage for dramatic monsoon wind reversals, strong ocean?atmosphere interactions, and intense seasonal rains over the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Australia. Recurrence of these monsoon rains is critical to agricultural production that supports a third of the world's population. The Indian Ocean also remotely influences the evolution of El Ni{\~{n}}o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), North American weather, and hurricane activity. Despite its importance in the regional and global climate system though, the Indian Ocean is the most poorly observed and least well understood of the three tropical oceans. This article describes the Research Moored Array for African?Asian?Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA), a new observational network designed to address outstanding scientific questions related to Indian Ocean variability and the monsoons. RAMA is a multinationally supported element of the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS), a combination of complementary satellite and in situ measurement platforms for climate research and forecasting. The article discusses the scientific rationale, design criteria, and implementation of the array. Initial RAMA data are presented to illustrate how they contribute to improved documentation and understanding of phenomena in the region. Applications of the data for societal benefit are also described. *Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory Publication Number 3199 and National Institute of Oceanography Contribution Number 4437},

  Abstract                 = {Large-eddy simulations are made for the canonical Ekman layer problem of a steady wind above a uniformly rotating, constant-density ocean. The focus is on the influence of surface gravity waves: namely, the wave-averaged Stokes-Coriolis and Stokes-vortex forces and parameterized wave breaking for momentum and energy injection. The wave effects are substantial: the boundary layer is deeper, the turbulence is stronger, and eddy momentum flux is dominated by breakers and Langmuir circulations with a vertical structure inconsistent with both the conventional logarithmic layer and eddy viscosity relations. The surface particle mean drift is dominated by Stokes velocity with Langmuir circulations playing a minor role. Implications are assessed for parameterization of the mean velocity profile in the Ekman layer with wave effects by exploring several parameterization ideas. The authors find that the K-profile parameterization (KPP) eddy viscosity is skillful for the interior of the Ekman layer with wave-enhanced magnitude and depth scales. Furthermore, this parameterization form is also apt in the breaker and Stokes layers near the surface when it is expressed as a Lagrangian eddy viscosity (i.e., turbulent Reynolds stress proportional to vertical shear of the Lagrangian mean flow, inclusive of Stokes drift) with a derived eddy-viscosity shape and with a diagnosed vertical profile of a misalignment angle between Reynolds stress and Lagrangian mean shear.},

  Abstract                 = {A multi-scale asymptotic theory is derived for the evolution and interaction of currents and surface gravity waves in water of finite depth, under conditions typical of coastal shelf waters outside the surf zone. The theory provides a practical and useful model with which wave--current coupling may be explored without the necessity of resolving features of the flow on space and time scales of the primary gravity-wave oscillations. The essential nature of the dynamical interaction is currents modulating the slowly evolving phase of the wave field and waves providing both phase-averaged forcing of long infra-gravity waves and wave-averaged vortex and Bernoulli-head forces and hydrostatic static set-up for the low-frequency current and sea-level evolution equations. Analogous relations are derived for wave-averaged material tracers and density stratification that include advection by horizontal Stokes drift and by a vertical Stokes pseudo-velocity that is the incompressible companion to the horizontal Stokes velocity. Illustrative solutions are analysed for the special case of depth-independent currents and tracers associated with an incident surface wave field and a vortex with O(1) Rossby number above continental shelf topography.},

The model is based on Fourier modes and describes sinusoidal shear flow, in which the fluid between two free-slip walls experiences a sinusoidal body force. The model contains a total of nine modes, including modes describing the basic mean velocity profile and its modification, downstream vortices, streaks, and instabilities of streaks, with other modes being a consequence of the non-linear interactions. The transition to turbulence for the model is subcritical and intermittent, and the distributions of turbulent lifetimes are exponential, in agreement with observations in many shear flows.},

  Abstract                 = { In his landmark paper of 1883, Reynolds addressed the question of why the fluid motion along a pipe changes from a laminar to a turbulent state at modest flow rates. His discoveries have remained a focus of hydrodynamic stability for the intervening 125 years, and the central puzzle of why the transition takes place at all remains unresolved. It is an enigma as all theoretical and numerical evidence suggests that the base state of fully developed flow, Hagen-Poiseuille flow, is linearly stable. The transition to turbulence is abrupt, mysterious, and largely dependent on the quality of the facility used in any experimental investigation. It is therefore not an example of transition via a sequence of instabilities or bifurcations in which considerable success has been achieved over the same period. Despite wide-ranging research activity that has uncovered many important pieces of the jigsaw, the central puzzle remains unresolved. The purpose of this review is to bring together the available experimental evidence and attempt to extract a set of accepted facts about this important problem. },

One- to two-year record length mean balances are approximately linear and steady state. Monthly to seasonal time scale variations are also governed by linear dynamics, with imbalances between the pressure gradient force and surface wind stress leading to zonal mass transport variations along the equator. Interannual variations in zonal transports along the equator associated with Indian Ocean Dipole events in 1994 and 2006 are likewise consistent with linear dynamics. These results provide a valuable benchmark for evaluating models of equatorial Indian Ocean circulation on seasonal time scales.},

The modes resemble the 30?50 day oscillation. A series of general circulation model experiments designed to test the effect of suppressing this feedback on low-frequency variability in the model tropics is described. The results suggest that the evaporation-wind feedback can be important to the amplitude of the spectral peak corresponding to the 30?50 day oscillation in the model, but that the existence of the oscillation does not depend on it. The feedback is found to have a much more dramatic effect on low-frequency variability when sea surface temperatures are fixed than when the lower boundary is a zero heat capacity ?swamp?.},

This time series of dissipation measurements at a fixed site and with a wide range of wind speeds indicates that a constant fraction of the energy flux in the atmospheric boundary layer appears as dissipation in the mixed layer. Our measured velocity-shear spectra are consistent in shape with an isotropic-turbulence spectral form and simultaneous determinations of spectral level from two mutually perpendicular sensors are consistent with isotropy. Significant changes in turbulence levels between two profiles a few minutes apart are observed. These changes (often a factor of 10) emphasize the necessity of adequate space-time averaging to obtain good mean values of ?. Including data from measurements of the large-scale density and velocity fields, the generation of the observed turbulence is thought to be Richardson-number instabilities in the mixed layer rather than direct surface phenomena such as wave breaking.},

  Abstract                 = {`Bioconvection' is the name given to pattern-forming convective motions set up in suspensions of swimming micro-organisms. `Gyrotaxis' describes the way the swimming is guided through a balance between the physical torques generated by viscous drag and by gravity operating on an asymmetric distribution of mass within the organism. When the organisms are heavier towards the rear, gyrotaxis turns them so that they swim towards regions of most rapid downflow. The presence of gyrotaxis means that bioconvective instability can develop from an initially uniform suspension, without an unstable density stratification. In this paper a continuum model for suspensions of gyrotactic micro-organisms is proposed and discussed; in particular, account is taken of the fact that the organisms of interest are non-spherical, so that their orientation is influenced by the strain rate in the ambient flow as well as the vorticity. This model is used to analyse the linear instability of a uniform suspension. It is shown that the suspension is unstable if the disturbance wavenumber is less than a critical value which, together with the wavenumber of the most rapidly growing disturbance, is calculated explicitly. The subsequent convection pattern is predicted to be three-dimensional (i.e. with variation in the vertical as well as the horizontal direction) if the cells are sufficiently elongated. Numerical results are given for suspensions of a particular algal species (Chlamydomonas nivalis); the predicted wavelength of the most rapidly growing disturbance is 5\&ndash;6 times larger than the wavelength of steady-state patterns observed in experiments. The main reasons for the difference are probably that the analysis describes the onset of convection, not the final, nonlinear steady state, and that the experimental fluid layer has finite depth.},

  Abstract                 = {The data for the spectrums of fully developed seas obtained by Moskowitz [1964] for wind speeds from 20 to 40 knots (10.29 to 20.58 m/sec), are used to test the similarity hypothesis and the idea proposed by Kitaigorodskii [1961] that, when plotted in a certain dimensionless way, the power spectrums for all fully developed seas should be of the same shape. Over the important range of frequencies that define the total variance of the spectrum within a few per cent, the transformed plots yield a nondimensional spectral form that is nearly the same over this entire range of wind speeds within the present accuracies of the data. However, since slight variations of the wind speed have large effects on the location of this nondimensional spectral form, inaccuracies in the determination of the wind speed at sea allow for some latitude in the final choice of the form of the spectrum. Also, since the winds used to obtain the nondimensional form were measured at a height greater than 10 meters, the problem of relating the spectral form to a standard anemometer height arises. The variability introduced by this factor needs to be considered. The results, when errors in the wind speed, the sampling variability of the data, and the anemometer heights are considered, suggest a spectral form that is a compromise between the various proposed spectrums and that has features similar to many of them. A spectral form is recommended for tentative application to the problem of wave forecasting by spectral techniques. Improved wind speed measurements (taken at several elevations and averaged over longer time intervals) and better wave data (taken for longer time intervals and analyzed so as to better fit the procedures) are needed so that the form of the spectrums of fully developed wind seas and seas limited by either fetch or duration can be determined with even greater precision.},

  Abstract                 = {A cooperative, multiplatform field experiment was conducted in the eastern North Pacific during February and March of 1990 as part of the Surface Waves Processes Program (SWAPP). One of the experimental objectives was to investigate Langmuir circulation so that its role in the evolution of the oceanic surface boundary layer could be better understood. The concurrent use of different observational techniques, ranging from simple surface drifters to complex Doppler sonar systems, resulted in new information about Langmuir circulation structure and variability. Estimates of Langmuir cell spacing indicated that a broad range of scales, from about 2 to 200 m, was excited during periods of strong surface forcing and that the energy containing scales evolved with time. Estimates of cell spacing based on Doppler velocities from a surface-scanning sonar directed crosswind showed this scale evolution, but estimates based on backscattered intensity did not. This was attributed to the fact that the intensity-based estimates were only indirectly related to circulation strength. The near-surface convergent velocities from the sonar were used to form an objective, quantitative measure of the temporal variations in Langmuir circulation strength. As expected, the circulation strength increased dramatically during strong wind events. However, circulation strength and wind stress did not decrease simultaneously, and Langmuir circulation was detectable for up to a day after abrupt reductions in wind stress. Energy from the surface wave field, which decayed more slowly than the wind, was apparently responsible for maintaining the circulation. The variation of circulation strength was found to be better related to (u*Us)½ than to u*, where u* = (τ/ρ)½ is the friction velocity, τ is the wind stress, and Us is the surface wave Stokes drift. This scaling is consistent with wave-current interaction theories of Langmuir cell generation.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of surface waves and an applied wind stress is studied in an ensemble of large eddy simulations to investigate the nature of deeply penetrating jets into an unstratified mixed layer. The influence of a steady monochromatic surface wave propagating parallel to the wind direction is parameterized using the wave-filtered Craik-Leibovich equations. Tracer trajectories and instantaneous downwelling velocities reveal classic counterrotating Langmuir rolls. The associated downwelling jets penetrate to depths in excess of the wave's Stokes depth scale, $\delta_\text{s}$. Qualitative evidence suggests the depth of the jets is controlled by the Ekman depth scale. Analysis of turbulent kinetic energy (tke) budgets reveals a dynamical distinction between Langmuir turbulence and shear-driven turbulence. In the former, tke production is dominated by Stokes shear and a vertical flux term transports tke to a depth where it is dissipated. In the latter, tke production is from the mean shear and is locally balanced by dissipation. We define the turbulent Langmuir number Lat = (v*/Us)0.5 (v* is the ocean's friction velocity and Us is the surface Stokes drift velocity) and a turbulent anisotropy coefficient Rt = /( + ). The transition between shear-driven and Langmuir turbulence is investigated by varying external wave parameters $\delta_\text{s}$ and Lat and by diagnosing Rt and the Eulerian mean and Stokes shears. When either Lat or $\delta_\text{s}$ are sufficiently small the Stokes shear dominates the mean shear and the flow is preconditioned to Langmuir turbulence and the associated deeply penetrating jets.},

  Abstract                 = {The climatological seasonal cycle of the upper equatorial Indian Ocean is discussed. A summary of the observations is given. Near the surface and below the equatorial thermocline, the observations indicate an intense variability of the equatorial currants, primarily at the semiannual frequency. In the thermocline, an eastward flowing equatorial undercurrent present in March and April is the dominant feature. An analysis of the temperature profiles in the upper 500 meters also indicates at all depths, seasonal vertical displacements well above the estimated uncertainty. At the semiannual period, the different isotherms are oscillating in phase in the upper western Indian Ocean and an upward phase propagation is present in the east. Displacements at the annual period have shorter spatial scales and are usually smaller, the near surface and the deeper oceans am separated at this period by a level of no displacements in the upper thermocline. The equatorial thickening of the thermocline in March?April in the central and western Indian Ocean also suggests the presence of an eastward flowing undercurrent at that time. To investigate the dynamics, a simplified wind forced linear model in the equatorial beta-plane is presented for a stratified Indian Ocean. The wind stress is applied as a body force over a mixed layer of specified thickness and below a dynamically induced mixing is included. A decomposition in vertical modes is done and the lower modes are solved with a numerical scheme from Cane and Patton. The dynamics of the higher modes are characterized by Yoshida jets (negligible zonal gradients) and an approximate solution is sought for them. The model response to wind forcing is sensitive to thew hypotheses with the surface equatorial currants being strongly dependent on the mixed layer depth and with the currents in the thermocline being controlled by mixing. The model reproduces many of the most salient characteristics of the observed seasonal cycle, both for the currents and the isotherm vertical displacement. As in earlier studies, this suggests that the wind stress near the equator is an important forcing of the equatorial Indian Ocean, at least to depths of 500 m. However, typical differences between the observed seasonal cycle and the modeled one are of the order of 10 days in phase and a factor 1.5 in amplitude. Sensitivity studies suggest that these differences could not be overcome by tuning the model adjustable parameters, but that they are likely to arise from the crude representation of the forcing as a body force and the neglect of the nonlinearities.},

  Abstract                 = {This report describes the general circulation and seasonal variation of currents in the equatorial Atlantic, concentrating on the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), using data collected as part of the Seasonal Response of the Equatorial Atlantic and Programme Fran{\c{c}}ais Oc{\'{e}}an et Climat dans l'Atlantique Equatorial experiments plus historical ship drifts. During 1983--1985 the Lagrangian circulation was studied by launching and tracking 30 freely drifting drogued buoys in the North Equatorial Countercurrent and 23 in the South Equatorial Current (SEC). In addition, continuously recording current meters were moored for 20 months at depths from 20 to 300 m near the center of the NECC, at 6$\deg$N, 28$\deg$W. These measurements are the longest series ever obtained in this current and provide information about its seasonal and interannual variations and zonal, meridional, and vertical structure. The seasonal cycle of the NECC is very regular from year to year. Each year the NECC starts up in May--June. It flows eastward across the Atlantic with surface speeds of up to 143 cm/s in the west, extending down to 350 m at 28$\deg$W, and flowing into both the Guinea Current and North Equatorial Current. It disappears or reverses from about January--June west of 18$\deg$W. Some near-surface water of the NECC is inferred to downwell and flow equatorward toward the Equatorial Undercurrent. The SEC flows into the North Brazil Current, which during spring continues up the coast into the Caribbean. During fall, however, the whole North Brazil Current retroflects, or turns back on itself, between 45$\deg$ and 50$\deg$W, forming the western NECC. The retroflection establishes a meander pattern in the NECC that slowly propagates westward during fall at a speed of 4 cm/s. The meanders have a displacement of about 300 km in latitude, a wavelength of 900 km, and meridional velocity fluctuations of up to 100 cm/s. The swift currents and time-dependent meanders in the western NECC cause a high eddy kinetic energy, $\sim$2400 cm2/s2, equivalent to that of the energetic part of the Gulf Stream.},

The response of an initially resting ocean to WWB forcing is compared with that for model oceans that are spun up with annual-mean surface fluxes and monthly varying fluxes.

  Abstract                 = {In an effort to measure current shear very near the sea surface a string of vector-measuring current meters suspended beneath a surface float was deployed 180 km off southern California at 34¬∞N 121¬∞30‚Ä≤W on November 26, 1981 and allowed to drift freely for over 6 days. This arrangement, which we call the current meter drifter (CMD), gave measurements at depths of 2.5, 5.5, 8.5, 11.5, 14.5, 25, and 63 m. During the first two days, when the winds were light (‚âÉ8 m/s) and variable in direction, a nearly uniform current shear was observed in the upper 15 m with a low-frequency velocity difference of 5 cm/s between the instruments at 2.5 and 14.5 m. During the last four days, when the winds were brisk (> 12 m/s) and steady in direction from the NNW, a strong downwind shear of order 10‚àí2 s‚àí1 was observed in the upper 10 m with a velocity difference of ‚àº7 cm/s between the instruments at 2.5 and 8.5 m. During this same period the shear below 10 m was much smaller. The average currents during the CMD drift veer to the right of the wind stress with angular displacement increasing with depth. Time series of the velocity difference between 2.5 and 5.5 m compare very well with Œ∏(t)u*Œ∫‚àí1 ln (5.5/2.5), where Œ∏(t) is the wind direction vector (of unit magnitude), u* = (wind stress/œÅ)¬Ω is the friction velocity in water, and Œ∫ = 0.4 is von Karman's constant. On the other hand, a similar comparison of the velocity difference between 5.5 and 8.5 m to Œ∏(t)u*Œ∫‚àí1In (8.5/5.5) is much poorer with observed velocity difference being much larger, possibly due to stable stratification effects. Possible errors in the measurements have been considered and estimated as less than the observed velocity differences. Near-surface shears as large as the observed are very important in closing the momentum budget for the oceanic boundary layer.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we review observations, theory and model results on the monsoon circulation of the Indian Ocean. We begin with a general overview, discussing wind-stress forcing fields and their anomalies, climatological distributions of stratification, mixed-layer depths, altimetric sea-level distributions, and seasonal circulation patterns (Section 2). The three main monsoon circulation sections deal with the equatorial regime (Section 3), the Somali Current and western Arabian Sea (Section 4), and the Bay of Bengal, seasonally reversing monsoon currents south of India and Sri Lanka, and the eastern and central Arabian Sea (Section 5). For the equatorial regime, we discuss equatorial jets and undercurrents, their interactions with the eastern and western boundaries, and intraseasonal and vertically propagating signals. In the Somali Current section, we describe the ocean's responses to the summer and winter monsoon winds, and outline the modelling efforts that have been carried out to understand them. In the Bay of Bengal section, we present observational and modeling evidence showing the importance of remote forcing from the east, which to a large extent originates along the equator. In the following three sections, we review the southern-hemisphere subtropical regime and its associated boundary currents (Section 6), the Indonesian Throughflow (Section 7), the Red Sea and Persian Gulf circulations (Section 8), and discuss aspects of their interactions with other Indian-Ocean circulations. Next, we describe the Indian Ocean's deep and shallow meridional overturning cells (Section 9). Model results show large seasonal variability of the meridional overturning streamfunction and heat flux, and we discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this variability. While the monsoon-driven variability of the deep cell is mostly a sloshing motion affecting heat storage, interesting water-mass transformations and monsoonal reversals occur in the shallow cross-equatorial cell. In the mean, the shallow cell connects the subduction areas in the southern subtropics and parts of the Indonesian Throughflow waters with the upwelling areas of the northern hemisphere via the cross-equatorial Somali Current. Its near-surface branch includes a shallow equatorial roll that is seasonally reversing. We close by looking at coupled ocean-climate anomalies, in particular the large events that were observed in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean in 1993/94 and 1997/98. These events have been interpreted as an independent Indian-Ocean climate mode by some investigators and as an ENSO-forced anomaly by others. },

This paper reviews climate phenomena and processes in which the IO is, or appears to be, actively involved. We begin with an update of the IO mean circulation and monsoon system. It is followed by reviews of ocean/atmosphere phenomenon at intraseasonal, interannual, and longer time scales. Much of our review addresses the two important types of interannual variability in the IO, El Ni{\~{n}}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the recently identified Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). IOD events are often triggered by ENSO but can also occur independently, subject to eastern tropical preconditioning. Over the past decades, IO sea surface temperatures and heat content have been increasing, and model studies suggest significant roles of decadal trends in both the Walker circulation and the Southern Annular Mode. Prediction of IO climate variability is still at the experimental stage, with varied success. Essential requirements for better predictions are improved models and enhanced observations.},

WWBs were detected over the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, but not over the Atlantic Ocean. WWB frequencies for each region were lag correlated with a sea surface temperature anomaly over the Ni√±o-3 region. WWBs tended to occur in sequence, from the western to eastern Pacific, leading the El Ni√±o peak by 9 months to 1 month, respectively, and after around 11 months, over the Indian Ocean. These results suggest that WWB occurrences are not random, but interactive with ENSO. Composite analysis revealed that most WWBs were associated with slowdowns of eastward-propagating convective regions like the Madden?Julian oscillation (MJO), with the intensified Rossby wave response. However, seasonal and interannual variations in MJO amplitude were not correlated with WWB frequency, while a strong MJO event tended to bear WWBs. It is suggested that the strong MJO amplitude promotes favorable conditions, but it is not the only factor influencing WWB frequency. An environment common to WWB generation in all regions was the existence of background westerlies around the WWB center near the equator. It is inferred that ENSO prepares a favorable environment for the structural transformation of an MJO, that is, the intensified Rossby wave response, that results in WWB generations. The role of the background wind fields on WWB generations will be discussed in a companion paper from the perspective of energetics.

  Abstract                 = {Sea surface temperature (SST) variations associated with the atmospheric intraseasonal oscillation in the tropical Indian and western Pacific Oceans, are examined using a one-dimensional mixed layer model. Surface fluxes associated with 10 well-defined intraseasonal events from the period 1986?93 are used to force the model. Surface winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts daily analyses and SST from the mixed layer model are used to compute latent and sensible heat fluxes and wind stress with the TOGA COARE bulk flux algorithm. Surface freshwater flux is estimated from the Microwave Sounding Unit precipitation data. Net shortwave radiation is estimated, via regression analysis, from outgoing longwave radiation. An idealized diurnal cycle of shortwave radiation is also imposed. The intraseasonal SST variation from the model, when forced by the surface fluxes estimated from gridded analyses, agrees well with the SST observed at a mooring during the COARE. The model was then integrated for the 10 well-defined intraseasonal events at grid points from 75$\deg$ to 175$\deg$E at 5$\deg$S, which spans the warm pool of the equatorial Indian and western Pacific Oceans. The one-dimensional model is able to simulate the amplitude of the observed intraseasonal SST variation throughout this domain. Variations of shortwave radiation and latent heat flux are equally important for driving the SST variations in the western Pacific, while latent heat flux variations are less important in the Indian Ocean. The phasing of the intraseasonal variation of precipitation relative to wind stress results in little impact of the freshwater flux variation on the intraseasonally varying mixed layer. The diurnal cycle of shortwave radiation is found to significantly increase the intraseasonal amplitude of SST over that produced by daily mean insolation.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical experiments were performed using a three-dimensional large-eddy simulation model of the ocean surface mixed layer that includes the Craik-Leibovich vortex force [Craik 1977; Leibovich 1977] to parameterize the interaction of surface waves with mean currents. Results from the experiments show that the vortex force generates Langmuir circulations that can dominate vertical mixing. The simulated vertical velocity fields show linear, small-scale, coherent structures near the surface that extend downwind across the model domain. In the interior of the mixed layer, scales of motion increase to eddy sizes that are roughly equivalent to the mixed-layer depth. Cases with the vortex force have stronger circulations near the surface in contrast to cases with only heat flux and wind stress, particularly when the heat flux is positive. Calculations of the velocity variance and turbulence dissipation rates for cases with and without the vortex force, surface cooling, and wind stress indicate that wave-current interactions are a dominant mixing process in the upper mixed layer. Heat flux calculations show that the entrainment rate at the mixed-layer base can be up to two times greater when the vortex force is included. In a case with reduced wind stress, turbulence dissipation rates remained high near the surface because of the vortex force interaction with preexisting inertial currents. In deep mixed layers (∼250 m) the simulations show that Langmuir circulations can vertically transport water 145 m during conditions of surface heating. Observations of turbulence dissipation rates and the vertical temperature structure support the model results.},

Because of the Richardson number dependence, the simulated internal waves exhibit a diurnal cycle, following the daily stability change in the mixed layer.

Turbulent fluxes distributed momentum input from the wind over a near-surface layer of variable thickness. Coriolis and pressure gradient terms combined to induce a wavelike response whose frequency was close to the local inertial frequency. Wind stress variations on near-inertial timescales interfered both constructively and destructively with the wave response, exerting considerable influence on the observed currents.},

  Abstract                 = {A westerly wind burst observed in the warm pool of the western equatorial Pacific Ocean cooled the ocean's surface layer by about 0.8$\deg$C. Turbulent entrainment at the base of this layer caused cooling but also heating due to the reversal of the vertical temperature gradient during rain events. Consequently, the cumulative effect of turbulent entrainment was minimized. Following the wind burst, a sustained eastward surface current contributed to high current shear and turbulent dissipation rates at the top of the thermocline. As a result, most of the heat transfer into the thermocline occurred after the wind burst had ended. The cruise-averaged turbulent flux into the thermocline was 17 $\pm$ 10 W m$-$2, which suggests that the annual mean is only a few watts per square meter. The restratification of the upper ocean in the aftermath of the wind burst is accounted for partly (but not wholly) by local turbulent entrainment. Despite heavy precipitation, upper ocean salinity generally increased during the cruise. Advection appears to have been the dominant factor governing local salinity changes.},

This is the state of marginal instability (MI), a stable equilibrium between forcing by the trade winds (which works to reduce Ri) and turbulence (which works to increase Ri). Besides providing insight into the physics of deep cycle turbulence, MI is easily recognized in moored records of currents and density, and may therefore provide a valuable indicator of turbulence in historical data where direct turbulence measurements were not made. In this initial study, the seasonal cycle of MI is described. MI is present for 9 months of the year but disappears in March, April, and May, consistent with the recently discovered springtime minimum of equatorial turbulence.},

In particular, it is often assumed that the onset of turbulence in internal waves begins in this way. Clear recognition of the importance of KH instability to ocean mixing arises from recent observations of the phenomenon in a broad range of oceanic environments. KH instability is a critical link in the chain of events that leads from internal waves to mixing. After 150 years of research, identifying the prevalence of KH instability in the ocean and defining useful parameterizations that quantify its contribution to ocean mixing in numerical models remain first-order problems.},

Sustained wind forcing generated a weakly stratified turbulent surface layer that extended to the top of the main thermocline. Following each rain event, freshwater formed a statically stable layer in the upper 4?12 m. The subsequent evolution of the mixing profile was strongly depth-dependent. Turbulence increased dramatically in the fresh layer adjacent to the surface but decreased in the underlying layer. The factor by which turbulence decreased following a given squall was strongly correlated with the net rainfall. The observed timescale for the decay of the turbulence was about 0.7 buoyancy periods, similar to decay times observed near the surface after sunrise. However, these decay times are significantly larger than those estimated indirectly (as the ratio of dissipation rate to turbulent kinetic energy) from turbulent patches in the thermocline. To account for the discrepancy, the authors hypothesize that turbulence production continues to act during the observed decay process, partially counteracting the effect of dissipation.},

  Abstract                 = {Dissipation rate statistics in the near-surface layer of the ocean were obtained during the month-long COARE Enhanced Monitoring cruise with a microstructure sensor system mounted on the bow of the research vessel. The vibration contamination was cancelled with the Wiener filter. The experimental technique provides an effective separation between surface waves and turbulence, using the difference in spatial scales of the energy-containing surface waves and small-scale turbulence. The data are interpreted in the coordinate system fixed to the ocean surface. Under moderate and high wind-speed conditions, we observed the average dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy in the upper few meters of the ocean to be 3-20 times larger than the logarithmic layer prediction. The Craig and Banner (J. Phys. Oceanogr. 24 (1994) 2546) model of wave-enhanced turbulence with the surface roughness length from the water side z0 parameterized according to the Terray et al. (J. Phys. Oceanogr. 26 (1996) 792) formula z0=cHs provides a reasonable fit to the experimental dissipation profile, where z is the depth (defined here as the distance to the ocean surface), c[approximate]0.6, and Hs is the significant wave height. In the wave-stirred layer, however, the average dissipation profile deviates from the model (supposedly because of extensive removing of the bubble-disturbed areas close to the ocean surface). Though the scatter of individual experimental dissipation rates (10-min averages) is significant, their statistics are consistent with the Kolmogorov's concept of intermittent turbulence and with previous studies of turbulence in the upper ocean mixed layer.},

  Abstract                 = {In a stably stratified shear layer, thin vorticity layers (&lsquo;baroclinic layers&rsquo;) are produced by buoyancy effects and strain in between the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortices. A two-dimensional numerical study is conducted, in order to investigate the stability of these layers. Besides the secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instability, expected but never observed previously in two-dimensional numerical simulations, a new instability is also found.The influence of the Reynolds number (Re) upon the dynamics of the baroclinic layers is first studied. The layers reach an equilibrium state, whose features have been described theoretically by Corcos &amp; Sherman (1976). An excellent agreement between those predictions and the results of the numerical simulations is obtained. The baroclinic layers are found to remain stable almost up to the time the equilibrium state is reached, though the local Richardson number can reach values as low as 0.05 at the stagnation point. On the basis of the work of Dritschel et al. (1991), we show that the stability of the layer at this location is controlled by the outer strain field induced by the large-scale Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortices. Numerical values of the strain rate as small as 3% of the maximum vorticity of the layer are shown to stabilize the stagnation point region.When non-pairing flows are considered, we find that only for Re &le; 2000 does a secondary instability eventually amplify in the layer. (Re is based upon half the initial vorticity thickness and half the velocity difference at the horizontally oriented boundaries.) This secondary instability is not of the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz type. It develops in the neighbourhood of convectively unstable regions of the primary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortex, apparently once a strong jet has formed there, and moves along the baroclinic layer while amplifying. It next perturbs the layer around the stagnation point and a secondary instability, now of the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz type, is found to develop there.We next examine the influence of a pairing upon the flow behaviour. We show that this event promotes the occurrence of a secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instability, which occurs for Re &ge; 400. Moreover, at high Reynolds number (&ge; 2000), secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instabilities develop successively in the baroclinic layer, at smaller and smaller scales, thereby transferring energy towards dissipative scales through a mechanism eventually leading to turbulence. Because the vorticity of such a two-dimensional stratified flow is no longer conserved following a fluid particle, an analogy with three-dimensional turbulence can be drawn.},

  Abstract                 = {The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has recently finished ERA-40, a reanalysis covering the period September 1957 to August 2002. One of the products of ERA-40 consists of six-hourly global fields of wave parameters, like significant wave height and wave period. These data have been generated with the centre's WAM wave model. From these results we have derived climatologies of important wave parameters, including significant wave height, mean wave period, and extreme significant wave heights. Particular emphasis is on the variability of these parameters, both in space and time. Besides being important for scientists studying climate change, these results are also important for engineers who have to design maritime constructions. This paper describes the ERA-40 data and gives an overview of the results derived. The results are available on a global 1.5$\deg$ $\times$ 1.5$\deg$ grid.

  Abstract                 = {We consider the weak (small Rossby numbers) non-linear interaction between a quasi-geostrophic vortex and the Ekman flow which is produced by a uniform wind stress acting at the top of the mixed layer. The differential advection of geostrophic vorticity by the undisturbed Ekman components tends to tilt the axis of the vortex away from the vertical but, because of the strong rotational constraint, the vortex maintians vertical {\textquoteleft}rigidity{\textquoteright} by developing vertical velocities which balance the advective tendency (and frictional rotation). In this approximate vorticity balance for a {\textquoteleft}frictional{\textquoteright} component of the total motion, the vertical integral implies a net vertical velocity ({\textquoteleft}Ekman suction{\textquoteright}) at the free surface. To maintain the proper boundary condition an equal and opposite velocity must be applied to a second (geostrophic) component of the motion. This coupling condition has been determined as a function of the surface wind stress, the gradient of geostrophic vorticity, and the depth of the homogeneous mixed layer. If the base of the mixed layer were rigid the vortex would move as a unit with the velocity of the mean Ekman drift. The suction velocity formula is then generalized to include the special case (Charney 1955) of a global wind variation and variable Coriolis parameter (Sverdrup 1947). The effect of the local wind in supplying kinetic energy to the deeper ocean is also discussed, and suggestions are made for including the baroclinicity of the friction layer into the geostrophic dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {In the summer of 2007, a biophysical experiment was conducted to identify physical processes that determine the delivery of invertebrate larvae and juvenile rockfish to rocky intertidal and kelp forest communities in northern Monterey Bay, California. The experiment was sponsored by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and collected physical measurements including velocity from acoustic Doppler current profilers, surface gravity wave heights measured acoustically, and temperature from thermistor chain arrays both along- and across- the inner shelf in water depths of 10 -- 60 m. The inner shelf is the transition between the nearshore and mid-shelf zones, and is defined where surface and bottom Ekman boundary layers overlap. Previous work has shown that the inner shelf in this region is rich in physical processes across many space and time scales. The goal here is to identify and quantify the dominant processes at the diurnal (24 hour) period. Diurnal tides contribute less than 10\% of the observed currents. Thus the focus is on the oceanic response to a strong (8 - 15 m/s daily maximum) along-shelf sea breeze which forces offshore surface Ekman transport, drives average upwelling velocities of 26 m/day, and cools the water column 2 -- 4 degrees/day. At 15 m (20 m) depth, measured diurnal surface transport is 36\% � 9\% (77\% � 12\%) of full theoretical Ekman transport. Examination of a diurnal heat budget shows that vertical advection is the dominant process during afternoon cooling (both horizontal advection and solar insolation are sources of heat during this period), and is needed to close the heat budget to within 5\%. In contrast, during evening/early morning heating 92\% of the observed heating is explained by along-shelf advection of a temperature gradient within the upwelling shadow, much greater than the heating attributed to either solar insolation (2\%) or onshore motions (2\%). Thus, the diurnal heat budget is closed to within a few percent and explained by two-dimensional processes: vertical advection by wind-driven upwelling during cooling and along-shelf advection during heating.},

  Abstract                 = {Winds and waves in marine boundary layers are often in an unsettled state when fast-running swell generated by distant storms propagates into local regions and modifies the overlying turbulent fields. A large-eddy simulation (LES) model with the capability to resolve a moving sinusoidal wave at its lower boundary is developed to investigate this low-wind/fast-wave regime. It is used to simulate idealized situations with wind following and opposing fast-propagating waves (swell), and stationary bumps. LES predicts momentum transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere for wind following swell, and this can greatly modify the turbulence production mechanism in the marine surface layer. In certain circumstances the generation of a low-level jet reduces the mean shear between the surface layer and the PBL top, resulting in a near collapse of turbulence in the PBL. When light winds oppose the propagating swell, turbulence levels increase over the depth of the boundary layer and the surface drag increases by a factor of 4 compared to a flat surface. The mean wind profile, turbulence variances, and vertical momentum flux are then dependent on the state of the wave field. The LES results are compared with measurements from the Coupled Boundary Layers Air?Sea Transfer (CBLAST) field campaign. A quadrant analysis of the momentum flux from CBLAST verifies a wave age dependence predicted by the LES solutions. The measured bulk drag coefficient CD then depends on wind speed and wave state. In situations with light wind following swell, CD is approximately 50% lower than values obtained from standard bulk parameterizations that have no sea state dependence. In extreme cases with light wind and persistent swell, CD < 0.},

  Abstract                 = {Factors affecting the along-axis coherence length of Kelvin-Helmholtz billows are reviewed. Little is known of the processes which determine or limit this length. Laboratory experiments show that, as they develop, billows may be irregularly spaced, resulting in pairing along their length, or, more commonly, grow at different rates in patches which subsequently amalgamate. Both processes result in features described as ?knots?, where neighbouring billows join. The tangling of billow vortices in the knots leads to local turbulence and mixing, often before turbulence develops at a smaller scale within the billows themselves. The axial coherence length of billows is limited to the along-axis distance between these knots. Such features in the atmosphere and the ocean have received little attention in spite of their possible bearing on clear-air turbulence and to heat and momentum transport. Observations of atmospheric billows suggest an axial coherence length which is of the same order as that found in the laboratory, about four billow wavelengths.},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution temperature observations above underwater topography in the deep, stably stratified ocean have revealed two distinctive turbulence processes. These processes are associated with different phases of a large-scale (here tidal) internal gravity wave: (i) highly nonlinear turbulent bores during the upslope propagating phase, and (ii) Kelvin-Helmholtz billows, at some distance above the slope, during the downslope phase. Whilst the former may be associated in part with convective turbulent overturning following Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities {\textquoteleft}RTi{\textquoteright}, the latter are mainly related to shear-induced Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. In this paper, details are particularly presented of rare (convective) RTi penetrating stable density stratification under high-frequency internal waves. Such {\textquoteleft}apparent RTi{\textquoteright} can be explained using both stability parameterization of entrainment across a density interface, and, more relevant here, internal wave acceleration overcoming the reduced gravity.},

  Abstract                 = {Large eddy simulations of the Craik-Leibovich equations are used to assess the effect of misaligned Stokes drift and wind direction on Langmuir cells in the ocean mixed layer. Misalignments from 0$\deg$ to 135$\deg$ are examined and Langmuir turbulence structures are evident in all cases. The Stokes drift is modeled using a broadband empirical spectrum, and cases with and without the Coriolis effect, wind waves, and an initial mixed layer are examined. The expected scaling for the vertical velocity variance is recovered in the aligned simulations and is adapted here to the misaligned cases. The adjusted scaling projects the friction velocity (aligned with the wind stress) into the dominant axial direction of the Langmuir cells. The turbulent Langmuir number is generalized through a similar projection into the axial direction of the Langmuir cells, which reduces its value in realistic conditions. For known Langmuir cell orientations, the strength of Langmuir turbulence for misaligned cases can be estimated using the projected Langmuir number. A prediction for the angle between the wind stress and cell direction is obtained using the law of the wall; this prediction only requires the wind stress, Stokes drift, and boundary layer depth. Conditional analyses show that, with increasing misalignment, the typically antisymmetric Langmuir cell pairs become asymmetric. This asymmetry is due, in part, to the advection by cross cell flow of vorticity from one vortex tube onto the other, and in part due to an asymmetry induced by the stretching of vertical vorticity into cross cell vorticity.},

A few hundred swimming cells are observed simultaneously and the average parameters of the cells' motility are calculated. The time-dependent, two-dimensional distribution of swimming velocities is measured and the three-dimensional distribution is recovered by assuming horizontal isotropy. The mean and variance of the cell turning angle are quantified, to estimate the reorientation time and rotational diffusivity of the bottom-heavy cell. The cells' phototactic and photokinetic responses to the laser light are evaluated. The results are generally consistent both with earlier assumptions about the nature of cell swimming and quantitative measurements, appropriately adjusted. The laser-based tracking method, which makes it possible to average over a large number of motile objects, is shown to be a powerful tool for the study of microorganism motility.},

  Abstract                 = {A major goal of the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) was to achieve significantly more accurate and complete descriptions of the surface meteorology and air-sea fluxes in the western equatorial warm pool region. Time series of near-surface meteorology from a buoy moored near the center of the COARE Intensive Flux Array (IFA) are described here. The accuracies of the measurements and the derived fluxes are quantified; agreement between average net heat fluxes at the buoy and two nearby research ships is better than 10 W m?2 during three intercomparisons. Variability in the surface meteorology and fluxes associated with westerly wind bursts, periods of low winds, and short-lived, deep convective events characteristic of the region was large compared to the 4-month means. The ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) analysis and prediction fields differed most from the buoy data during periods of short-lived, deep convective events, when several day averages of the net heat flux differed by more than 70 W m?2 and had the opposite sign. A one-dimensional ocean model run to examine the sensitivity of the upper-ocean response to differences between the observed and the ECMWF fluxes illustrates the importance of the short-lived events as well as of the wind bursts in maintaining the temperature of the warm pool.},

  Abstract                 = {Microstructure measurements in the equatorial Pacific at 140°W in late 1984 show a pronounced diurnal variation in both high-frequency internal wave energy and kinetic energy dissipation rate. Observations indicated that after sunset, internal waves (presumably generated by convective overturns in the mixed layer) propagate downward and increase turbulence levels in the pycnocline. It is proposed that large mixed layer eddies in the South Equatorial Current interact with the large shear caused by the Equatorial Undercurrent to generate a westward going anisotropic wave field. The momentum transport in the radiated wave field results in a drag force on the equatorial mean flow field. The observed mean wind stress at 140°W during Tropic Heat I (which is twice as large as the annual mean wind) is closer to the estimated radiation stress (∼−10−4 m2 s−2) at the base of the mixed layer (≈30 m) than to the estimated turbulent stress (∼−10−5 m2 s−2). A wave dissipation model based on the observed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is introduced in order to estimate the wave momentum flux divergence in the stratified region above the undercurrent core. The model predicts that most of the downward wave momentum flux penetrates through the undercurrent core. It is hypothesized that when the wind stress is strong, the equatorial Pacific Ocean responds by generating a westward traveling internal wave field which transports much of the surface wind stress below the actively mixing surface layer.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of a rain-produced, fresh surface anomaly observed in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool was modeled by use of the Princeton Ocean Model with Mellor-Yamada turbulent closure. The simulation was forced by a wind stress of 0.12 N m$-$2 and surface cooling of 225 W m$-$2. Following spin-up, 34-mm average rainfall was applied over a small portion of the domain. When rainfall ceased, momentum was trapped in a 1-m, fresh surface layer, and turbulent mixing was inhibited below the layer. Seven hours later, the surface density anomaly was reduced by an order of magnitude, and the surface velocity anomaly in the direction of the wind was 0.15 m s$-$1. The simulations show upwelling at the upwind edge of the anomaly and downwelling at the downwind edge with maxima of 15 and 35 m d$-$1, respectively. The momentum balance for the velocity component in the direction of the wind indicated that local acceleration, horizontal advection, and vertical diffusion were in approximate balance except at the downwind edge of the anomaly, where pressure gradient terms were also important. The budget of turbulent kinetic energy showed that shear production plus buoyancy production (or destruction) was approximately balanced by dissipation in much of the anomaly; advection and vertical turbulent transport terms were significant at some depths at the edges. The strength of the surface density front at the downwind edge of the anomaly tended to increase with time relative to the front at the upwind edge.},

The objective is to take advantage of the well-known numerical properties of methods based on expansions in terms of trigonometric functions in applications for which inhomogeneous boundary conditions and/or irregular domains are desired. The underlying mathematical idea is the exchange of inhomogeneity from boundary conditions to forcing terms. The fundamental techniques for handling inhomogeneity in boundary conditions, symmetry mismatches between body forces and dependent variables at boundaries and the imposition of boundary conditions on internal or immersed boundaries are described and illustrated using simple idealized examples. These techniques are then combined to illustrate how these methods can be applied to several examples of flows from laboratory experiments.},

The concept of gravitational available potential energy is used to formulate an energy budget in which the evolution of the background potential energy, i.e. the minimum potential energy attainable through adiabatic motions, can be explicitly examined. For closed systems, the background potential energy can change only due to diabatic processes. The rate of change of background potential energy is proportional to the molecular diffusivity. Changes in the background potential energy provide a direct measure of the potential energy changes due to irreversible diapycnal mixing. For open systems, background potential energy can also change due to boundary fluxes, which can be explicitly measured. The analysis is particularly appropriate for evaluation of diabatic mixing rates in numerical simulations of turbulent flows. The energetics of a shear driven mixing layer is used to illustrate the analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The Mirai Indian Ocean cruise for the Study of the Madden?Julian oscillation (MJO)-convection Onset (MISMO) was a field experiment that took place in the central equatorial Indian Ocean during October?December 2006, using the research vessel Mirai, a moored buoy array, and land-based sites at the Maldive Islands. The aim of MISMO was to capture atmospheric and oceanic features in the equatorial Indian Ocean when convection in the MJO was initiated. This article describes details of the experiment as well as some selected early results. Intensive observations using Doppler radar, radiosonde, surface meteorological measurements, and other instruments were conducted at 0$\deg$, 80.5$\deg$E, after deploying an array of surface and subsurface moorings around this site. The Mirai stayed within this buoy array area from 24 October through 25 November. After a period of stationary observations, underway meteorological measurements were continued from the Maldives to the eastern Indian Ocean in early December. All observations were collected during an El Ni{\~{n}}o and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event, which tended to suppress convection in the western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean in throughout much of November 2006. However, as the IOD began to wane in mid-November, an abrupt change from westerly to easterly took place in upper tropospheric winds in the MISMO study region. By late November and early December, deep convection developed over the central Indian Ocean and eastward movement of large-scale cloud systems were observed. This article describes these variations in detail and how they advance our understanding of the onset of tropical deep convection on intraseasonal time scales.},

This seasonal variation in the zonal surface current propagates westward, as do seasonal variations in the Equatorial Undercurrent and zonal surface winds at the equator. At 5$\deg$N and 5$\deg$S, the seasonal variations in the 20$\deg$C isotherm and dynamic height also propagate westward. Conversely at the equator in the eastern and central Pacific, the variations in 20$\deg$C isotherm depth and dynamic height propagate eastward. These seasonal variations are interpreted by means of a simple dynamical model based on linear equatorial wave theory. Model results indicate that seasonal variability between 5$\deg$N and 5$\deg$S is dominated by wind-forced equatorial Kelvin waves and first meridional mode Rossby waves of the first and second baroclinic modes. The sum of the Rossby waves and Kelvin waves results in westward propagation in the equatorial zonal currents and off-equatorial thermal structure and, yet, eastward propagation in thermocline depth and dynamic height along the equator in the eastern and central Pacific.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a dynamically motivated analysis of observations, and an intermediate-level coupled model, the interannual variability within the equatorial Atlantic is studied. It is found that a significant part of the observed variability can be described by an equatorial coupled mode akin to ENSO (El Ni{\~{n}}o?Southern Oscillation). The Atlantic mode signature is even more tightly focused on the equator and is situated proportionally farther to the west within the basin than its Pacific counterpart. Model simulations capture the equatorial coupled mode in relatively pure form and, for what are thought to be the most realistic parameter choices, show interannual oscillations favoring a 4-year period, which are not self-sustaining. The simulated spatial patterns agree well with those extracted from observations, including those features that distinguish the Atlantic from the Pacific. Sensitivity experiments show that the Atlantic coupled-mode signal is less robust than the corresponding Pacific ENSO signal but is still well-defined qualitatively, within reasonable parameter ranges. The results demonstrate that the primary mechanisms of oscillation for the Atlantic and Pacific are the same but that differences in the zonal structure and strength of air?sea coupling and mean ocean stratification offset the large differences in basin size, allowing similar oscillation periods for the two basin modes. An explanation for the distinct spatial patterns of simulated Atlantic and Pacific anomalies is found in the differences in climatological mean fields and ocean basin configurations. Together, the observational and model results present a picture of equatorial Atlantic variability in which coupled equatorial dynamics play an important but not exclusive role. It appears that the coupling is sufficiently strong to leave its imprint on the total variability but too weak to dictate it entirely, even at the equator.},

  Abstract                 = {Tropical and extratropical interactions on the intraseasonal time scale are studied in the context of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Madden?Julian oscillation (MJO). To simplify the discussion, a high (low) MJO phase is defined as strong (suppressed) convective activity over the Indian Ocean. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter season, a high (low) AO phase is found more likely coupled with a high (low) MJO phase. Based on the regressed patterns and composites of various dynamical fields and quantities, possible mechanisms linking the AO and the MJO are examined. The analysis indicates that the MJO influence on extratropical circulations seems more evident than the AO influence on tropical circulations. The MJO interacts with the AO through meridional dispersion of Rossby waves in the Pacific sector. The geopotential height anomaly center over the North Pacific associated with the MJO can either reinforce or offset the AO Pacific action center. As a result, the AO pattern can be greatly affected by the MJO. When the AO and the MJO are in the same (opposite) phase, the Pacific action center becomes much stronger (weaker) than the Atlantic action center. The eddy momentum transports associated with the MJO in the Pacific sector are closely related to the retraction and extension of tropical Pacific easterlies and the subtropical Asian?Pacific jet. Because of its large scale, this regional effect is also reflected in the zonal mean state of wave transport and wave forcing on zonal wind, which in turn affects the phase of the AO.},
